i ve had this thermometer for about num_num years . 
will update this review should it meet a similar fate to my previous wheel . 
this product does what it is suppose to do . 
i purchased this filter for a braun num_extend coffeemaker . 
if your bike had a kickstand on the plate it won t lock down . 
there are so many sketchy sellers selling phone chargers out there ,  that it can be a bit scary . 
very good price but this one harder to use than my cusinart . 
i wanted a coffee maker with no bells and whistles ,  just a good basic machine . 
enough was enough !  but this plantronics is the exact opposite of my original device . 
they are thinner and retain memory than the older ones . 
it makes a buzzing sound when devices are plugged in . 
also they are large enough so that they don t get lost in my utensil drawer . 
i could barely get through it they taste so nasty . 
the base is fairly heavy ,  but using too heavy a speaker could cause it to become top heavy . 
i don t use it every day ,  but approximately num_num times per week . 
haven t decided if we will replace with another one or go for a burr grinder this time . 
so now i have to use two pads when one would have been enough before . 
so ,  to me this is pretty darn  instant  . 
either than or the developers decided to do their own . 
once i figured out the screen protector to apply is inside the two outer shield protectors . 
the pair made in mexico is much better . 
i m selling mine to make room for something else . 
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this one . 
then i noticed my upper arms felt rough ,  which turned into a bumpy rash a few days later . 
obviously ,  this is not the pouch s fault ,  but it s something to be aware of . 
i use this as a little office supply shelf . 
it looks like i ve splashed glitter all over my face . 
i would expect a digital tuning method on a wireless headphone which cost fifty plus bucks . 
went to the second one using the same method ,  no go . 
durable and seems similar quality to apple products . 
it was not as good as our much cheaper model . 
so not that great for leaving on at night . 
i have many oxo products ,  and i ve always been pleased . 
my wife and i received this as a gift to add to our num_extend and num_extend copper core pans . 
i also prefered the blade weight and thickness of the wustof . 
when i contacted the company the response was that they shipped it . 
make sure the pins line up with the contacts . 
it turned out just fine to replace what i had lost . 
and ,  there were many things we liked about this game . 
ridiculous !  i had trouble getting it on with zero bubbles . 
i ve been through so many of these ineffective silly things . 
love the way these roll instead of sliding on the rod . 
today we had a cup of this soup and it is classified as a light soup . 
he loves his as much as i love mine and now ,  i dont have to share . 
if amazon . com sells it for about fifteen ,  it should be a good value . construction : this is a hard case . 
product arrived on time and was wrapped well . 
after a few days i noticed i was unusually fatigued . 
what a waste . nhl num_extend is virtually unchanged since last year barring some minor menus alterations and updated rosters . 
the jawbone may perform admirably as far as technology . 
they pile up nice in the closet and clean up great in the dishwasher . 
i like this jabra earboom so much that i have purchased num_num of these so far . 
i had it a long time now and i still love it . 
this battery worked perfectly !  it is a genuine motorola accessory and arrived quickly . 
you have to look inside to see the cup markings but i just can t tell where the water is . 
at this output it can take num_num hours or longer to charge a num_num mah battery . 
one likes to carry it when he greets me at the door and when he s excited . 
this offers really good protection for the phone . 
this is one of the best vacuums i ve ever come across . 
one minute per slice seems like a good rule of thumb so far . 
i used a krusteaz brand belgium waffle mix purchased cheaply at walmart  and they turned out great . 
needless to say ,  when you use this device ,  you are going to attract attention . audio is pretty good . 
i would have given this five stars except for the only complaint i had . 
still ,  perhaps the search for the perfect cup of coffee is worth it . 
did nt have time to return it before christmas so bought another necklass . 
i d heard the musical one was loud and annoying and just wanted the simple model for my daughter . 
i bought these some time ago and my wife has been using them without incident . 
the metal is very sturdy and the non stick finish is great . 
i did the research on griders and found this one to be the best for the price . 
the charger seemed to charge the phones quickly ,  never ran hot like prior charger . 
the flap also is good and does not come loose at all . 
another num_num calories from the other num_num grams of carbohydrates . 
these do not fit the power head as well ,  and almost seem like they might pop off during use . 
these are supposedly cotton ,  but they don t feel like it . 
one major complaint is the micromanagment of collecting  shards  . 
sharp cutting edges make your pies look as good as they taste . 
i tried supergluing the magnets back on to no avail . 
no comment on the strainer since i have not used it yet . 
i m a male ,  a bachelor who lives alone . 
recently threw in the trash as the line wore out . 
overall we will not be purchasing this product again . 
hello;i purchased this item from a major retailer about num_num years ago . 
i have several of these ,  well worth it . 
i would recommend to anyone who wants a pda . 
i believe it was about $ when it came to market . 
great charger ,  though there may be cheaper options . 
you can also freeze veggies in these and pop them into boiling water to reheat . 
been cooking for many years and the young ones in the family wanted one for last xmas . 
i guess i just consider it mostly my cole slaw preparer and find it marvelous for that use . 
i wore them so i won t send them back but i won t buy them anymore either . 
just do not think that this is a game that you will get out often  or even every christmas  . 
the whole thing gets hot when you use it . 
i received the wrong color and it shreds easily . 
it made me wish i had a mouse and all of the aiming issues would have dissapeared . 
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely worth the price . 
the espresso maker requires a very fine grind to get good flavor from the beans . 
blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets ,  and glassware . 
i will never buy hamilton beach products again . 
the description on the website did not state that the straps were elastic . 
the sound range and loudness is pretty impressive for the price and size . 
they still shift in friction mode ,  but for the price they should last a lot longer than they did . 
great for about anything you want to shred ,  cut or mix . 
we re too stupid to put together normal sounding sentences . 
order it with something else ,  and you ll get free shipping . 
the box is very shallow and not easily covered securely . 
this is not worth the money and the brand name is misleading . 
the plot was well done ,  the graphics wonderfully creepy ,  and the weapons cool . 
i don t think pie weights are for me . 
the head set is quite comfortable  at least for me  . 
you can buy num_num or num_num of them for the cost of a battery at your telephone store . 
when i take a call ,  i have to be carefull to answer using the button on the headphones . 
sure enough ,  did not work ,  not enough power to push the dough through . 
i recently burned myself trying to extract artichokes from a pot at a friend s house . 
the cars that come with this garage are cute . 
after looking around the inside i could see the grooves in which it separated from . 
spyro games always used to be fun ,  but that tradition ends here . 
washing it is a breeze and just takes a second . 
fits as described when arrived however when washed they shrink and continue to shrink with each wash thereafter . 
once glitch ,  which i did not view as all that negative . 
i have had this mount for about a year and it works great . 
this happened after about num_num years of use . 
the computer recognized the usb connection ,  but the cursor never moved . 
either these are counterfeit oral bs or oral b has let the quality degrade substantially . 
so i bought this product hoping it would help to regulate my cycles . 
but it s not bad for wireless ,  i ve had worse . 
exactly what i need for my phone and at the best price possible . 
you can make it fit on the left ,  but not the right ,  and vice versa . 
the metal part where you power the adapter came loose ,  even though i never unplugged the usb cable . 
i would not even give my current one away . 
shipped free directly from realook and arrived within two days . 
i of course treated it with a wood sealant to last through the winter . 
we have been treating our hair for months and finally got this . 
i bought this set for our toaster oven . 
easy to put on and i have no problems . 
it does charge my kindle ,  but other important devices are left in the dust . 
i think that is the way to keep the fish moist . 
a gamer looking for this kind of experience simply has too many options to chose from these days . 
is that what you re looking for ?  go elsewhere . 
not that we should of had to do that . 
my mouth feels very dry and i am thirsty after drinking this . 
for that it is perfect . however ,  in either application i am weary of the design of the clip . 
it was just one and that s not a big deal . 
my cat just isn t at all interested in these springs . 
and now i don t need as much help driving as i used to :   . 
i haven t had any problems with teflon flaking off . 
i only wish the vacuum head was a little larger . 
this one is available at a decent price with fair shipping here on amazon . 
obviously we all have our own preferences for taste . 
it finally began to make a weird clicking sound when unplugged and was becoming quit rusty in the bottom . 
i like almost everything except cucumber juice  echhh  . 
since that time i have replaced the game . 
one great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning . 
kind of reminded me of airhead candy . now the fruit taste is pretty good actually . 
took her to the vet who told me the otc products don t really work that well . 
the otterbox was just too bulky ,  a real pain in the bum trying to type and more . 
auto shut off after num_num hours ,  which is a good feature . 
i thought i d try this first without anything in it ,  just to see if my cats liked it . 
even after several days ,  they are air tight in a wine bottle . 
i bought this in num_num and the pan is still in great shape . 
surely not worth what was paid for it by half . 
once you play one match ,  you ve played them all . 
the color grew on me after a day or so and i kind of liked it . 
i m just looking forward to the day i get to replace it . 
but other than that ,  i don t use on in my daily life . 
it does make the overall length a little shorter but works well when you are in the car . 
i have natural dark red brownish hair and this product turned some strands of my hair pure black . 
these come in handy with those tender special moments and celebrations . 
i like neutrogena products as a rule ,  so this was a disappointment . 
and yet it is compact and not too heavy . 
both english and metric measurements are embossed onto each spoon . 
i wish i could return it ,  but that would cost me as much as the refund would be . 
the original unreal tournament is the very definition of fun . 
the first time through ,  things really slowed down around level num_extend
two reviewers determined there are drivers to be downloaded but i was unsuccessful . 
the bar contains  agave nectar  which does not occur naturally . 
and it ll keep rice perfect and hot for up to num_num hours . 
because of the steel type ,  you need to hone it on a steel and that s usually good enough . 
i couldn t stand the persistent smell of feces in my apartment . 
the copper finish is coated with a clear plastic to prevent oxidation . 
it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling . 
first ,  i put them both under my tongue simultaneously . 
was given to me as gift ,  when i was in a tiny apartment . 
not a good product for conditioning even though it says it has shea butter . 
i would never recommend this terrible waste of money case . 
i ve used it twice and it has stopped working . 
i have been baking pies for num_num years ,  and always found that i could not get a perfect circle . 
i have made batches of bread for weddings and catering using num_num pounds of flour . 
i run it outside the window and connect it to a garden hose . 
belt works fine and installed in just a few minutes . 
there are quite a few decent standard sized batteries available for under $ on amazon . 
the packaging changed and when i opened the new bag ,  it didn t smell like the old one . 
this pump is either too annoying to figure out or it just does not work with presta valves . 
obviously the margin of safety  from overflow  is much smaller . 
i paid $ for this when i bought a few other pieces . 
can t imagine how it acts when you heat style your hair . 
it would have been a better product if the plastic bowl was a bit more sturdier . 
because it s too big for my cup holder . 
i would buy again if the shipping wasnt so long . 
amazon was good to give me a refund right away . 
it will look like junk at first but after drying for a few hours it will clear up . 
it crashed for no reason ,  saves got corrupted . 
i bought this toy for my boys a few years back . 
the only complaint i have is that this ear piece doesn t adjust to the inside of your ear . 
it has a cord that can be pulled out from the back and pushed back in for easy storage . 
if you are sensitive to maltodextrin ,  this isn t for you . 
so far has lasted for a long time and does not wear off . 
i bought two of these ,  and in about num_num minutes ,  the problem was solved . 
i would give this num_num stars but ,  as quickly as i pour water in ,  it starts pouring out . 
they were awesome and they work great i like them a lot thank you . 
then contact sharp and go on from there . 
the only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that . 
this will compete with any top of the line knife you can buy . 
maybe i got a bad clock ,  but based on what i got ,  would not advise purchasing it . 
dash mounts are either bulky and in the way or not strong enough . 
and i remembered to write review for this item only because this deserves the best rating i can . 
from the product description ,  i expected something far more robust than this unit . 
instructions say to leave the nook on when not in use ,  so i do . 
but failed to deliver !  superman is arguably one of the best comic book super heroes . 
i bought this protective cover case for num_num cents plus shipping . 
mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary . 
it has been more than num_num days so i cannot leave proper seller feedback or get a refund . 
we ve tried num_num of these waffle makers since jan num_extend
i bought these to put in goodie bags for my daughters num_extend birthday for her neon theme . 
the num_extend would randomly reset itself to factory default ,  causing me to lose all my information . 
i ll stick to my xbox for now ,  thanks . 
i like that the braun swirls around and seems to do better getting under the gums and between teeth . 
very sturdy with a good selection of teeth sizes . 
i ve used these a few times and broke them very easily . 
this one sits on our shelf collecting dust . 
i cook a lot and also brew beer at home ,  which requires frequent ,  accurate temperature readings . 
two days later i no longer saw them anywhere on the building . 
i use it a lot ,  and it never gave me any problem . 
the micro ,  however ,  requires that your computer first install a small program in order to be recognized properly . 
it s more powerful so i expect it to be a little louder . 
the handle is comfortable and holds the pitchers securely in your hands . 
that said ,  the mic did pic up everything it could . 
i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer . 
i hate myself for falling for the james bond license and wasting $
there are num_num bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight . 
it arrived really quickly and they always call me to let me know when they re making espresso . 
don t buy this unless you like replacing toasters . 
this cream will give you acne if you have sensitive skin . 
it is fast ,  auto shut off is great ,  cup is perfect size . 
bought it as an extra for my wife s phone and she says it works great . 
i would not buy anything else from this vendor . 
like playing pool ,  it wont hit the ball as hard as im trying too . 
i could feel some of the grains even after much shaking . 
the holes and cutouts aren t aligned quite properly ,  so mounting them on the screen is a compromise at best . 
i ll probably just delegate the product to my feet ,  if at all . 
the ones with black cords have a main button that has a hair trigger and doesn t click . 
and after all that ,  the base broke too . 
no more oil on my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel . 
it works great and i am very happy with it . 
the aftertaste is so overpowering i had to brush my teeth . 
if you re the type of person that likes to shoot ,  stay away from this product . 
the shipping charges are now lower and upfront on the order . 
the adjustable slicing disk is too thick ,  and even the shredding disk is too thick . 
i am actually afraid to open the remaining jars . 
the charging light illuminates ,  but does not charge . 
it s lacquered so the manual says not to place anything hot on top of it . 
doing this outside means no worry about smells ,  smoke ,  or a mess to clean up . 
i m not a huge health fanatic that knows all about the detox and clease process . 
my cats just leap over the sides which defeats the purpose of the whole thing . 
the product is not durable but it might just be the one i received . 
then she said  well you ordered the pu which is what you got . 
i ve had my misto about num_num months and feel it was a good purchase . 
i didn t have the rust problems that others had . 
a single  fairly small  burning incident led to utter destruction of the usability of the pan . 
in that short time ,  he ripped one wing off the toy . 
i bought it for a new iphone num_extend
i can t believe how beautiful and substantial this ice cream maker is . 
 i used a blade grinder for years before buying a burr grinder  . 
however ,  the price was amazing ,  so totally worth the purchase for an every now and then need . 
now i can have an extra battery charged and just pop it in if i run low . 
i don t have issues with maintaining the season or with the heating up time ,  etc . 
this one does the job i need it for !  . 
this item does not provide full coverage as the picture suggests . 
i had to splice my own cables before i found this for a couple bucks . 
i don t want the bulk of an otterbox defender . 
these definitely open up your nasal passages and functionally work as advertised . 
i have to disagree with the poster who said it is a bit better than a hammer . 
and i just paid the same thing for the num_extend size ?  !  shame on you amazon . 
tuffy liners that resist these thorns but i wanted a wider one for the tires on my bike . 
my phone did a better job of noise canceling . i think all bluetooth technology is the same . 
but if you deal with case of this kind in the past you will get use it . 
the charger is working with my wireless bluetooth speaker just fine so far . 
and if you read the instructions carefully before going at it ,  you won t encounter any problems . 
this is a fantastic idea ,  however it has some flaws . 
although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a little worse . 
if you can afford it step up to something that will last . 
i won t be buying from this vender ever again . 
this is a very convenient tool and certainly gets that last bit of dirt everything else might leave behind . 
neither one of them show any interest at all in it with or without the small catnip pouch added . 
soon enough i got a deeper scratch on the protector that didn t just rub off easily . 
some say it s not heavy ,  others say it is way too heavy . 
i m starting to hate it because i don t need to upgrade . 
i guess you could say so what it s a ladle . 
i thought the concept was good; scuffy thinks otherwise . 
every product i own from them has failed or been a letdown . 
fast; better than a blender and is easy to use . 
overall i love them ,  and would probably buy them again . 
i am still giving it four ,  though ,  because i love it . 
the only thing i d like to see is one usb pass through so you don t lose a usb slot . 
she played with it for about num_num seconds ,  put it down ,  and never looked at it again . 
they are pretty long and works fine if you just want to charge apple devices . it doesn t sync at all . 
the belt clip is great ,  i use it on my backpack when backpacking . 
however ,  your skin needs to be able to breathe to perform these functions . 
the bread isn t even completely toasted ,  just singed badly on the edges . 
i would not trust anything bigger than iphone num_extend
i use it atleast num_num times a day for tea ,  and i haven t encountered any num_extend
in fact ,  we noticed the bait was slowly disappearing white the door was never closing . 
i have a  made in usa  version of this . 
i think it helped a little in between showering but not as much as other dry shampoos . 
this is the perfect size for me but ,  apparently ,  it is not as popular as the other sizes . 
i have two of them in different locations in my house . 
then i put the cream on my feet especially around my toes and heels . 
the voice from the earpiece says  connected  on successful completion . 
otherwise ,  you re better off using a  regular  much and a coffee maker or tea bags . 
you can go to any chain store and do better . 
since i didn t ,  i urge you to do so and avoid having a $ loss on your hands . 
i ve been leaving it on all night and there s still plenty of water in it next morning . 
i simply treated it how i would assume a curling iron works . 
they come with full instructions and not much more to say . 
the htc evo v is the same phone as the htc evo num_extend on sprint . 
also the  free will  option is an absolute joke . 
if you are stir frying your ingredients  i . e . 
went looking for them and you had them . 
and there s a reason for that ,  it isn t !  slips right out of every pedal i have . 
i have been extremely happy with my purchase . 
my husband tried to reshape it to fit properly on the bowl ,  but with little success . 
i enjoyed the sword in single player but in multiplayer was a very frustrating weapon to fight against . 
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess . 
it is also real wood which matches our table and it doesn t look cheap . 
so i read the reviews for the phonedevil matte clear sreen protector and decided to give it a shot . 
i am glad that i did not spend a fortune on the electric models . 
i only own plastic cooking utensils ,  never stack them and always hand wash . 
video and sound on the num_extend tv was super that i connected the cable too . 
this coffee grinder does exactly what it s promised to do :  grinds perfectly ,  quickly and easily . 
of course in most sports games ,  graphics shouldn t matter . 
i had it professionally installed at a local bike shop . 
it s very simple and takes up very little space on the pot rack . 
fill the pan half way with water ,  and put it to boil . 
this ring looked beautiful on out of the box . 
just like other people ,  their brand name led me to believe they were natural . 
i did some research ,  and went with this one . 
i figured this would be a great alternative to use during the six weeks . 
i bought this for my num_num month old from santa for christmas . 
buy from amazon because the price is much much better than buying from the blackberry website . 
i think all of this sugar is toxic to my body and will not buy this anymore . 
we purchased this so our daughter could have fun toy to play with . 
it stopped making sounds within a day and he has no interest in it now . 
this item is not made for charging while using ,  so that is something to take into consideration . 
please reply with the filter part number and your location . 
it also added a lot of bulk and as a result no cases fit with the phone . 
comes with a  towel  to clean the phone before placement . 
these are great stands ,  but my yamaha speakers didn t fit either of the screw sizes provided . 
i woke up with basically an oil slick on my face . 
no battery to wear out and have to replace . 
it doesn t have a flashy design  basic black  ,  and it has the requisite glass pitcher . 
like i said ,  it works ,  these are ok . 
i don t understand how it s possible for such a big brush to deposit so little product on my lashes . 
i won t be flipping this one . now i ve owned it a while and used it several times . 
i put it together to surprise my husband . 
this gets the job done for the price . 
seems to working fine in my mother s humidifier . 
mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook . 
it hasn t done anything for his thin coat though . 
they send you num_num because each one lasts about two days . 
i felt i must have missed something if the reviews were so good . 
i never let it sit in water ,  and stand it on it s side ,  drain side down ,  to dry . 
it pushed right through the job with no trouble . 
on the other hand for power grating you ve got something here . 
i have to lower the rating another notch . 
there is no clock for different locations you can put on your home num_extend no world weather . 
the norpro pasta rack makes life so much simpler ,  and takes up allot less space . 
better than a hand vac  dustbuster  if bending down isn t easy for you . 
the remaining sticker is attached to the second film . 
i use it for my line of work and it stands up . 
i was very excited to see this color come out so when it did ,  i jumped on it . 
i have purchased fairly cheap holders from motorola and they lasted a while . 
i was surprised as the box seemed to be in good shape . 
the cheese came out light and fluffy wished i had had one earlier . 
great headset ,  solid build quality and blocks out the wind . 
outdoors requires the phone to be holstered on the same side of my body as the num_extend
it s super durable ,  super versatile ,  and is an excellent way to store food . 
noise  !  !  !  this is the loudest shaver i have owned . 
for example ,  the box says there s an led battery indicator light . 
i was looking forward to this game for a couple of num_extend
as a video game fanatic i can say that the days of milton bradley are long since over . 
i have a fairly energetic ,  playful cat and she was not interested in this product . 
num_extend when your in combat ,  you can t do anything else but stand there . 
one corner is slightly taller than the other but its hardly noticeable . 
the game is fun if you are in jail and time is not an issue . 
i am so glad we chose this one . 
we use these alot and they work great . 
i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets ,  sigh . 
i guess i ll replace the hardware ,  but it will cost me more than the garter in the long run . 
i really like the zagg screen protectors for my phones ,  and i ve used them for years . 
i have gerd and will have to keep searching for one that is comfortable ,  but supportive . 
i pretreated the worst stains withwoolite pet stain . 
these run quite small even though they are stretchy . 
i have dropped the phone onto a tile floor and it is fine . 
the la prima ran about half a shot then choked the machine . 
i think i will return and stick with wool gloves . 
like showdown : legends of wrestling , it has too many glitches to count . 
this thing increased my battery life by almost half ! honestly ,  it doesn t really make your phone that much bigger either . 
with medium usage its closer to about num_num hours . 
i thought that was a bonus ,  but as it turns out this sucker sucks the life out of batteries . 
as a professional i would not purchase it again ,  nor would i give it as a gift to anyone . 
i have another mounting system from this same manufacturer in my personal vehicle and am also pleased with it . 
per the game ,  phasers are used to take down shields and photon torps are used to damage the hull . 
i purchased a nook color for my grand daughter s birthday and she worn out the usb cable . 
there are num_num blue lights to indicate the level of the unit s charge . 
as soon as you see it ,  you ll be struck that it looks like a work of art . 
the kids played it for a little while ,  but became quickly bored by it . 
the bottom most container is not as small as one would think . 
since applying this method i have made great bread everytime num_extend weeks straight as of today  . 
if you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors . 
after reading that some people have issues with kombucha tea ,  i googled it and read some more . 
she handed it back to me and picked up her ginsu knife . 
the pump is powerful and draws from the bottom ,  so there is very little waste . 
these are really just the thing for chocoholics !  very useful and well made . 
packaging tends to heat quickly and melts while noodles take awhile to get to the right temperature . 
works great !  love it for zesting orange ,  lemon or lime zest . 
the suction cup is very high quality ,  with a strong lever that doesn t cause worry with each use . 
got all excited ,  but this taste nohthing like honey at all . 
that s what it does and it does it well . 
now very happy with it despite the problem with the fluid leaking out of the sprayer . 
finally ,  i ordered this battery since mine was going dead and malfunctioning during the day . 
i actually am so impressed with the service that i might consider switching to tracfone to save money !  . 
my greek tort doesn t care for it !  !  neither do i . 
my num_num dogs like premium edge and they seem pretty healthy and happy with it . 
i use this for num_num hours and work ,  my car ,  and home . 
lastly ,  the metal connector on the battery connector popped off because it was poorly glued . 
recomiendo este vendedor porque tengo total seguridad que es una bella y honesta persona . 
it scrolls way too easily and way too smoothly . 
they feel good ,  they take and hold a good edge and are quite reasonable . 
however ,  this is an example of how rosle got it right . 
a little at first ,  more with each successive try . 
it fulfills my modest requirements ,  and exceeds my expectations in appearance . 
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee . 
just grip the sides ,  rub it over the fruit ,  and the zest practically falls off . 
i had installed two of these for the front entrance of our house . 
it will hurt your nose ,  the area under your eyes ,  and especially around your ears . 
i had to get some from the phone store . 
it hasn t caused me any problems so far ,  but it s something to be aware of . 
you can probably run them over with your car and still be okay . 
look up videos on swype if you want to see it in action . 
the wheel oftenly stuck and wont turn on its rail . 
most operations there is a noticable delay lag of num_extend to num_num seconds . 
you can t mess it up ,  and if you do mess it up ,  you can fix it . 
this car mount ,  mounts very securely but the button to adjust the width broke . 
there was nothing at all to indicate that belkin manufactured this item . 
my little girl wanted this for her birthday ,  so we got it . 
i like that is is durable and washable . 
this meter is technology from a decade ago . 
i do not like this belt because of lack of material . 
too small and not the quality i expected . 
it just smears it around until the water evaporates into the air . 
the aluminum ones get stained and ugly after a few uses . 
i purchased this based on rave reviews from others . 
you can t go wrong with this one . update :  i use this knife every day . 
i don t know where it went looking but it was a long long trip . 
breaking up cooked hamburger ,  breaking up powdered sugar ,  etc .  .  .   . 
it is quiet ,  but that reflects a weak fan resulting in poor airflow . 
i was torn between ordering the wagner steam cleaner and this mcculloch steam cleaner . 
on top of the poor quality and the misleading information provided ,  % of them were smashed to pieces . 
adds some bulk to phone but not a large amount . 
it s built very well and i think it will last a very long time . 
i think they should get the folks who designed the hardware to redesign the software interface . 
making nutella cookies ,  very dry and hard ,  it is very frustrating . 
i guess maybe there are some people that this product could help . 
it was priced the lowest of all the choices ,  but it is an incredible piece . 
place it in the freezer and close the door . 
it also looks as pretty as the day i bought it after months of use . 
open carefully and handle the zippers with care . 
when i think weeding ,  i think small weeds that need to be pulled . 
with sliced cheese in lieu of french bread on a fruit and cheese plate . 
it didn t have the smell a lot complained of though . 
also noticed that the wand doesn t like to stay attached when not in use . 
some of them gave me bubbles ,  some came off right away after sticking on the screen for num_num minutes . 
have to make sure i turn it so the cord plugged into it blocks the light . 
i ordered these high handle boots because i have the shorter bog boots and love them . 
i told myself that it added  character to the baker ,  that i was not  obsessive  like detective monkon t . 
if you forget ,  it will cement to the sides and you have to either soak it or scrub harder . 
i have been using it twice a day since i received it . 
it had a great cost and a great product . 
i put in a password but router won t recoginize it . 
you do have to hold a bowl when catching the meat you re grinding . 
worse ,  the controls are so confusing that it gives me a headache . 
if i could rate this product a half star that would be touch much credit . 
now i have a game that i don t ever want to play . 
nokia knows how to design a very good interface . 
these type honeywells have been around a long time . 
basically ,  this product is a ripoff on consumers . 
the cap is large enough to turn over and collect the ground beans ,  unlike the grinder this one replaced . 
i just wouldn t try to use it as if it were a professional model . 
in fact ,  with all the shaking ,  it might even disrupt your game play . 
this is honestly the only case i ve thrown away in the garbage . 
i ve had many lighters and this one might be the best . 
its good that its made in canada rather than china . 
i have had no problem with either piece and highly recommend the products . 
now it s just another car charger  like the other num_num i already had and didn t really want another of !   . 
the return shipping cost via prime is more than what the actual refund would be . 
this machine is no match for the new consoles . 
if they had performed as billed ,  it would have been a good deal . 
as a single man ,  this is a perfect product for my morning drink . 
maybe i just got a bad one but i would recommend staying away from these . 
i contacted the company and they said that the shipment had been lost . 
it s the lame players that drives halo multiplay into the ground . 
good for one day only . and opi test this product on animals . 
first of all ,  syrup shouldn t run ,  it should ooze . 
it stays stable in your ear very nicely and is surprisingly very comfortable . 
great idea ,  but for me ,  just didn t fit my needs . 
also it gets very hot while plugged in ,  which freaked me out . 
returned product but from what i ve heard it does the job . 
i had others try ,  just to be sure it wasn t me but it did not fit . 
drinking the coffee was slightly less unpleasent than the smell suggested it would be . 
it is worse then no lube because it gets soooo sticky . 
this little butter bell is a fantastic buy . 
this headset is awesome ,  the sound quality is truly amazing . 
i would have given a five star if the packaging with some bubble wrap . 
birds or squirrels . tried num_num different kinds of bird food . 
 unless you re singing a bass part .  .  .  .  it s a pity ,  really ,  because otherwise the sound quality is quite good . 
nothing bad to say about this wonderful innovation at all . 
not only does it do the job very well ,  the price is right . 
it stay clean and does not collect food stains . 
however ,  definitely does not work like a new battery . 
what a ripoff !  learn from my mistake ,  do not buy . 
i ve used other ones that were better and lasted me more than one day without any sprays . 
and still the focus was extremely soft or just plain terrible . 
i never have problems answering the phone this way with my blackberry . 
i also tried a cheaper brand of slip on rubber broad heads . 
easy to apply and it works very well . 
in the summer ,  when the flies are marinating at a simmer ,  getting within num_extend is not advisable . 
other brands in this large of a container are glass . 
i wore my first one out by pouring hot gravies in it . 
also ,  don t use that yellow cloth to clean your phone . 
the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling . 
yes ,  they are light ,  and are not durable at all . 
there is some tension in them after assembly ,  and they disconnect pretty quickly . 
i bought this to hold some of my  overflow  knives that would not fit into my knife block . 
for me ,  however ,  it was not something i d use again . 
follow a super simple recipe with basic ingredients ,  and have delectable crispy waffle cookies in a few minutes . 
after trying to fix num_num with only minor problems i have decided to cut my losses . 
i purchased these batteries based on the reviews of others . 
she could have decorated her carrying case herself . 
there are companies that make dog biscuits with the activated charcoal in it . 
i think i give the edge in sound quality to jaybird ,  but not by a wide margin . 
i ve learned that companies make varying degrees of quality . 
it just sits in standby ,  which will last a long ,  long time . 
thought ,  hey why not try something different might work . 
as far as they re concerned this is a tub of water ,  not a litter box . 
audio isn t a religion and these are not holy water . 
i m sad because others seemed to really like it ,  but mine just didn t work . 
i also enjoyed the smell ,  a little fruity with a hint of coconut . 
doesn t really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods . 
it is hard to go to anything else now that i have used this . 
the cookbook that comes with it is adequate . 
the stove comes with no canister !  !  !  take into consideration when buying it . 
overall ,  i do not recommend this to anyone and i will not be ordering from this seller again . 
sometimes i m there for up to num_num hours . 
it has a num_num year warranty on defects too . 
the real thing is nong shim shin noodle ramyun . 
this sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing .  .  . so i ordered some . 
this just doesn t have enough power to massage my shoulders and neck . 
with a couple of bucks you could make something a lot better yourself . 
pokemon ranger has to be one of the shittiest and most pointless editions to the pokemon franchise ever . 
i had much better luck with the other three pairs mentioned . 
this cover does exactly what it is designed to do . 
easily moved to various locations depending on need . 
i have read reviews from wine experts that it doesn t work . 
and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied . 
the top portion where it has the fluval logo must be above water at all time . 
i bought as a gift ,  so was a little embarrassed the materials weren t a bit better . 
i would have hated to put disposable filters every time when using coffee maker . 
i could have bought a $ mini and it would have worked just as well . 
when purchased i discovered there was a newer product update :  model num_extend
be gentle with this pencil ,  it is not made for practical use or anything !  !  !  . 
i just got this and recently got a chance to use it . 
it s like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends . 
then along came this zester which i use constantly . 
i purchased it from one of the first  infomercials  . 
 the bowl is too light  we even had it on a rubber mat . 
will break in over time though ,  it s rubber . 
it is so small . get a racket ball . pass this one by . 
i do love tea ,  but these ingredients sound a bit too harsh for me . 
that is not to say that these treats are bad by any means . 
the buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking . 
i m sure it depends on your age and body type . 
overall they look and felt like a well made shoe and would have loved them to fit him . 
what s not to love ?  !  ?  !  it makes my plain white ceramic crock look like junk !  . 
the transmit strength on this compact num_extend is pretty strong . 
there is no ac charger ,  only a cigarette lighter charger with a micro usb plug on one end . 
generally if a toy makes noise ,  i don t mind so much . 
i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i like this pan . 
toasts bread ,  muffins and bagels with lots of options to choose . 
there was almost nothing i liked about this product . 
i used the product for five days straight before running out . 
my num_num year old didnt like to do this at all and thought it was boring . 
i haven t used them yet as the old one isn t broke ,  just yet . 
tastes in between the classic american blonde ale and cowboy golden lager . 
i purchased the screen protectors for my evo . 
and ,  yes !  i did use clumping litter ,  the good kind . 
i m very happy with it . i did have one problem within the first couple months of use . 
so i guess it s really a matter of preference . 
put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms . 
i almost didn t buy these because of the bad reviews ,  but i like  em . 
first of all ,  this will void whatever warranty you have with microsoft . 
this is the old faithful water filter pitcher . 
i shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future . 
and it is very possible that these are good cables . 
what slides over the back is a silicone cover then a hard and slippery cover over that . 
would be five stars if it was out of slightly heavier material . 
all technology becomes cheaper eventually ,  but if you think you need it ,  it s totally worth the num_extend stars . 
we use a bread machine to prepare the dough and provide the first rise . 
it will not fit like the model unless the sides along the chest area is taken in . 
the bottom part is stretching after only a month of owning the case . 
our dog is scared of thunder and fireworks and the thunder shirt makes no noticeable difference in him . 
i ve been happy with most oxo products i ve purchased . 
i bought two eight packs an num_num out of the pack broke within one month use . 
it s good to go the next morning ,  completely clean . 
but it didn t do anything for my face . 
i got this for my num_num month old daughter for christmas . 
one appliance we tried had the heating element inside the carafe and gave the water a burned plastic taste . 
other than that small problem ,  this is a great bt headdest . 
feels like it ll float away if it s not plugged in ,  lol . 
it can be a pain to pull out and turn the knob enough to disengage the cover . 
everyone is always commenting on how cute the cases look and where we got them . 
they pee in it about once a week ,  if that . 
i only ordered on here because they were alot cheaper . 
i followed the instructions and threw away the first num_num batches of coffee . 
insert the micro usb to your phone and enjoy your widescreen display . 
to ataris credit ,  this game was a bit fun . 
loved the deffender case hated the apple phone . 
i say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too . 
i bought this for her when she was nine months old and she showed no interest . 
trying to slide to a different screen instantly turns it back off . 
it can t be tightened at that point to fix it . 
wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym . 
so rather than being forced to pay interact for a num_extend upgrade ,  go there instead !  . 
it not educational or exciting and it s annoying . 
in our home which is num_num stories ,  it did not boost the cell phone range well . 
i spent $ for the num_extend and overall it was not worth the cost . 
im thinking num_num gem stones in at least a num_num inch wheel . 
i use it quite often ,  and it looks and functions as well as the day i bought it . 
i can use a creamy concealer on it . 
all the earlier re games have an annoying tendency of allowing the character to die ,  a lot . 
i ve had this vice ,  bench ,  or cradle ,  whatever you might call it . the material is strong . 
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap . 
blade release buttons are simple to use which makes cleaning easy . 
if you like it ,  fine :  come back here and buy it . 
i ordered it and it was delivered well in time . 
its high quality ,  cooks nice ,  cleans nice ,  and looks nice . 
even though the upgrade was purchased through the ovi store ,  it would not install . 
even though it it more powerful than the playstation ,  it is still second to it . 
one of the biggest gripes i had with this game was how the fighting resembled mortal kombat s style . 
shame on what otherwise has been a reliable company with several other respectful products . 
my husband is excited about it because he s the main chef in our house . 
the only time i ever played doom on the pc was when someone installed the simpson ? s wad . 
it s works consistently ,  cleans up easily ,  stores a way nicely . 
they are horrible !  !  !  i really think they are fake . 
any character can be anything you want and carry any weapon you want  for a necessary price  . 
my husband said it was obvious so i had to return it . 
speedloader is very hard to use especially with an extended magazine . 
i bought this is a gift for my brother . 
mind you the oem xoom charger is not like that at all . 
not as good as my plantronics headset , but certaintly good enough for the times i am listening to music . 
not what you want to be putting on our face if your fighting acne and oily face . 
i bought this because it came with great reviews ,  however my lab mix had it apart in hours . 
the front of the case features a sliding cutter ,  allowing you to neatly cut bags in a straight line . 
until i removed it to wipe everything down including my little camera eye in the back . 
for the price tag ,  its nothing to rave about . 
i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces . 
i had to buy one out on the road . 
i have a dobie so it would be insulting to offer him just one of these tiny treats . 
the hummers will love your simple ,  homemade nectar and you will have saved a ton of money . 
 : pi also have limited space in my kitchen . 
this particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department . 
wish it had a crank or something to make it easier . 
i m tired of cheaply made ,  high priced appliances . 
i won t give this to the new puppy i m getting . 
maintenance cleaning is fast ,  neglected cleaning takes more time and repeated cleanings . 
i bought this skillet for steaks and fried potatoes  , and fried eggs . 
if it doesn  have threads and has a geometrical triangle pattern on the side of it ,  skip this cap . 
i tried to get a bucks attention during the rut and he didnt even turn his head . 
note that i got mine from an amazon store called  small appliance  . 
i also love it because the jar is plastic . 
i had this pen for about a week and a half before it dried up . 
this is a very good product and has done a very good job foe me . 
i really should return it ,  but have already disposed of the box like a dummy . 
as stated by the many reviews ,  this is an exceptinal carpet cleaner . 
i purchased a thai stick and followed the instructions ,  putting it on wet right after a shower . 
the buttons are easy to press and it answers without any issues and seems fairly reliable . 
i practically felt like i threw away my money on this one . 
rechargables do not power this toy at all ,  you have to use regular ,  and it drains batteries fast . 
delicious over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal . 
you ve probably seen them use it on iron chef . 
maybe it just needs broken in and some fine fitting . 
after four days of that ,  i gave up and chucked it . 
the other thing is that the silicone attracts a lot of lint from your pockets . 
in num_num thq came out with this wrestling game . 
i now use ll ,  only three days and i already feel the coarser texture of my lashes . 
i think that dsp manager is the stock one for android phones . 
i didn t have enough of them to return . 
sigh ,  i have better things to do than beg my dog to eat . 
i ve tried everything ,  even putting ice cubes in the water ,  he just doesn t like it . 
it seems to go right through your system only lasting about an hour or two . 
i purchased this to replace a knife that was lost . 
all you need is a few swipes of this sharpening steel on the blade and you re all set . 
i cannot recommend this product for anyone trying to fix a leaky transmission . 
they fit small and fit weird ,  the waist was too high and the style was all wrong for me . 
it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller . 
nevertheless ,  it does a fine job for what it is supposed to do . 
for me this was a most disappointing product . 
it is not often you see a company stand behind its products without the least bit of prompting . 
i carefully followed the instructions quoted by other reviewers ,  but it still did not work . 
this is just a little too low quality . 
all came well sharpened and ready to go . 
i have had two of these cans outside for over a year . 
this cuts down on waste and you don t have to ingest harmful propellants . 
the lid is the best part of the pot ensemble . 
this is due to the short lived cheaper lasers they put in them . 
i tried burning through itunes as well as roxio and i am not a novice . 
whatever the case ,  i couldn t be more unhappy with this purchase . 
these make great little night lights for the kids . 
i ve tried the pulls with prongs that go along side the cork . 
i think i am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving . 
games like gem journey are easier to play with a stylus like this . 
no dead pixels ,  no dead touch areas ,  and the viewing angle is just like the oem . 
it is great if you have more than one guest to serve . 
i didn t like the smell ,  very strong and i gave me a headache . 
i ve not had this happen with my wusthofs . 
be sure to only inflate it half way or less ,  if its over inflated it will be very uncomfortable . 
as a flower child s child ,  growing up ,  i saw these at every commune we lived . 
i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out wonderfully . 
that is ,  the spill risk is very low even in pitching and rolling boston s subway . 
i got this as a gift for my son . 
i think this size wont do a bigger bird than num_num pounds . 
first ,  there is nothing about this to really write home about . 
making seperation and cross contamination containment a very easy . 
the item was considerably different quality than pictured . 
i cannot wait to show it off ! thank you !  . 
scrambled eggs come out beautifully in this pot ,  as does chocolate ganache and buttercream frosting . 
the roomba just thinks it s furniture and doesn t go up on it . 
the measuring spoons would make a great stocking stuffer for any kitchen queen . 
the zester was easy enough to clean after use . 
if i had to critique ,  i d say that the entire thing is a bit of a contraption . 
$ is too much to pay for a $ cable . 
but for now ,  i m quite happy with this . 
i ve read technical reviews on other adapters and they all say the same thing . 
they corrected the listing and now it looks like they have the right bags pictured . 
take the plug off and put it in the dishwasher !  how easy is that ? it s good size . 
perfect size for preparing dishes . it really works well . 
so i d recommend you get something else a little bit more expensive and save yourself the hassle . 
hopefully you won t have to go through this nonsense . 
that said ,  it wouldn t matter much where this appliance was made ,  it totally rocks . 
 the last time i did it was a year ago  . 
this product is being used for dollar size pancakes . 
i agree with the others that this was tough to open . 
i am trying to replace a num_num year old polder timer that looks very similar to this one . 
i must find a way to return them . 
just look at the container ,  its tomato sauce ,  what could go wrong . 
it also separates the solution from the water so you can rinse as you go which is wonderful . 
does increase volume but does not feel nice to the touch . 
i don t see what others have liked about this . 
it also gets a little moronic when you have to fight a bunch of undead . 
i can carry it in my pocket and use it when i need to . 
the tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged . 
the seller leaves a piece of paper saying if you re not happy with your order email us . 
i have no idea why this is a cult favorite . 
it makes an annoying sound when it is on . 
it gives a slight itch sometimes but is easy to brush on and gives full coverage . 
but i do think the zagg does have a better resistance to scratches and dings . 
me too is a nice brand and make very comfortable shoes . 
apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review . 
love it !  really handy to set by the stove . 
of course ,  the other side of that is that it looks incredible sitting on the counter . 
i treated it very gently ,  and it didn t last long at all . 
adequately long cord . made in china ,  hence no reliability . 
the jeans were not tight in any way ,  so it wasn t that . 
it s the tannest ivory i ve ever seen !  and it s crazy thick . 
however ,  anyone with a little sense can easily tell this is not for the european sgs ii . 
poor quality control . actually it looks like used pedal ,  not like new . don t recommend this product . 
but this one does the job very nicely . 
the price is fine ,  just a shame that it might not be that sturdy . 
you need to manually set the device back to paring mode in order to pair with another cell phone . 
with this i say i work giving support to the u . s . 
we tried doing it the way another reviewer did it ,  in a video but failed time and again . 
it does not do anything to cover the front or have a lip of any kind . 
first things first ,  make sure you are ordering the right headset . 
i m a fan of symbian and find it easy to operate . 
plugs the ipad into my car and works great . 
i m convinced vacuum sealing works just as advertised . 
this game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about . 
my phone is also in a form fitting case that i keep in this pouch and it fits fine . 
this case is amazing !  !  !  it fits perfectly and it protects it perfectly also . 
another  energy  product that simply wastes our money . 
very well designed and easy to figure out . 
it does not move to and fro as another reviewer described . the blade on this unit can be replaced . 
this is the only nautilus shoe i ve ever tried so take my fitment complaints with a grain of salt . 
i like it better than any of the forman items . 
within a year ,  everyone noticed that its cosmetic and physical condition deteriorated greatly . 
this game gives you no incentive to keep playing . 
i use this thing to core out the inside of a potato . 
once it dies i will purchase a better unit . 
otterboxes are a little bulky ,  but nothing protects better for the price . 
they ve changed the formula and now i notice after an hour or so my hair appears oily and limp . 
i thought this was the hard plastic screen cover and it isn t . 
i am not very good at decorating baked goods ,  and this tool makes everything look a professional made it . 
this style of meat pounder is sort of commodity like . 
would suggest using one of the toy bubblers amazon sells . 
i don t think i could have asked ,  or gotten a better cordless headset . 
nice not to have a burner going for hours . 
i don t think she is on board with the idea of something that she can chew ,  but not destroy . 
that will kill off all the lint that got trapped under and remove all bubbles . 
plus ,  it s not very filling ,  even for rice . 
i ve used it once and i won t be using it again . 
one of the gimmicks of this game was that it was a fighting ,  shooting ,  and driving game . 
i want another set !  !  !  i have another ,  cheaper set that i use only as backup now . 
i also bought the num_num foot one and have no doubt it s not sheep or lambs skin . 
the cables seem rather basic and work well ,  except one problem . 
this cord seemed like a deal and got good reviews . 
i can t believe i haven t owned one of these before . 
this unit makes the best french fries i ve ever made . 
it s probably my phone but it happens constantly since i got the battery . 
i believe a professional transaction is just as important and adds to the quality of the item . 
it works with all types ,  but works best with roma tomatoes . 
just received the case today ,  two days after receiving my epic touch num_extend from amazon wireless . 
that does not hold true for this product . 
careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates . 
just wipe the plates with a paper towel . 
it also charges my device so when i wake up i have a full battery . 
i bought these expecting a soft head ,  but it was rather hard and i really don t like them . 
if you pump it up less than about num_num times ,  you ll get a stream ,  not a mist . 
i bought these six months ago when they were $ through amazon prime !  i couldn t pass up the deal . 
i wire tied the offending wire out of harm s way and all is well . 
i had high hopes for this product since i bruise easily . 
i can t believe that i didn t buy these sooner . 
the recipe that comes with it is tasty . 
it s still going great ,  i just needed more capacity . 
like i said ,  it does a similarly excellent job for pork chops and other relatively lean cuts of beef . 
this is called cheating !  i expected canister with fuel at least . 
the inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all . 
the graphics of out break were with out doubt quite possibly the best num_extend has ever seen . 
it opens cans ok ,  but no better than the old fashioned openers . 
also ,  the knife is easy to maneuver despite its length . 
this extreme bottle didn t have any scent that make me feels it not working well . 
and when holding a chord ,  the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds . 
they don t look like cardboard anymore ,  but they are just really ugly ,  really pixelated sprites instead . 
i have no doubt that it will hold up well through the years . 
if you know how to use it ,  it might last a long time . 
i d rather be a little less healthy and a little more happy . 
it s really pretty much just alcohol ,  and because of that it stings . 
the bottle is tiny and despite what is written ,  the bottle doesn t have a dropper . 
try explaining to a two year old why her tattoo keeps  breaking  . 
i had two problems ,  one caused the rating to num_num num_extend
the kids thought it was great ,  but it got old pretty quick . 
it stays on and i unplug it when it s done . 
it s a hard plastic case ,  but with a matte finish and a really silky feel to it . 
this did not stop odor and my pets wanted to eat it . 
marineland does a very good job with their led aquarium systems . 
once the charger is removed ,  the phone starts working ,  again . 
have to make sure it is put on right or coffee and grounds all over . 
for the price ,  this is a good buy . 
wheels are really ,  really cheap plastic . two stars because you can ride it ,  just at a snail s pace . 
the second time i took this to the range ,  i started to notice that i wasn t hitting the target . 
i had a less powerful one for num_num years before it finally gave out . 
and it s a bread knife and nothing all that special . 
it s the year num_num now ,  and they re still making games that don t work . 
and theres no warning on any of these cans that i can identify . 
i should have expected since the only pictures i saw were art work and not game enviroment . 
no need to find storage place because it fits in any shallow drawer . 
this one has a simple system for changing out blades and is made from thick stainless steel . 
like they glued it together and shipped it out it seemed . 
i did not purchase my set from this vendor . 
they are cheerios ,  afterall ,  and we love the original kind . 
i used to use a good cooks brand safety opener and really liked it . 
it makes a farce out of a good num_num num_extend
i was disappointed to see this; in my mind ,  solder does not equate with stainless steel . 
it could be that i live in an apartment with hills and trees around . 
it really cut down my cooking time and has enabled me to experiment more as well . 
however ,  our cocoa of choice is from their indulgent collection and is called dark chocolate sensation . 
i miss my days of cracker eating before becoming gluten free . 
then both of them go into the dishwasher . 
great idea for a toddler toy but the microphone breaks or cracks when trying to work . 
both rub my dog raw and cause bleeding . 
i love my lodge omelet pan and use it almost every morning . 
tablets charge slowly ,  but that s to be expected . 
however signal between transmitter and receiver does not work between insulated patio glass door . 
however ,  an increasingly terrible dust allergy and trip to the allergy doctor convinced me to give one a try . 
i purchased this blender after seeing its number one rating by a leading consumer website . 
do not buy . i didn t expect much because of the cost . 
few ,  if any ,  are working as expected and thus i can t trust them for any backup work . 
my mothers dog has one from walmart ,  and my dog steals it every time we go home . 
this pan i have had for one year . 
i do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn . 
i did not buy from a num_extend party seller . 
it s just amazing how many flaws this game had ,  campared to how awesome the first game was . 
bento spoon and the boker knife which is quite nice . 
really confused ppl riding with me at first . 
i use the windshield mount with just the phone in my car because of size considerations . 
while the mascara is soft ,  it is not full . 
just try it once or twice more; i did ,  and my roots are silky soft and very clean . 
i ordered two of them and both arrived within a week . 
also ,  it creates more static than the one i m used to . 
i finally made he purchase and am glad i did . 
the dark coloring makes it impossible to view on the indoor setting when under bright lighting . 
i can t remember when i first bought this timer . 
it does not slip all over the place when using . 
overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean . 
coming from an asian background it s not something we normally cook with . 
it should reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
now i just need to buy a catch can for the bottle tops . 
it s this second part that really grosses me out . 
the extra width comes in very helpful to keep eggs from falling off . the handle is stainless and sturdy . 
i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out . 
because these knives will greatly appreciate on the collector s market . 
it does everything well except crush ice without liquid ,  i rarely do that . 
i liked this and was happy with my purchase . 
we juiced our garden lettuce and greens with ease . 
gave it to someone named happy on her birthday . 
the plot is explained through voice acting  not stellar ,  but i ve heard worse  and artwork . 
i m not really impressed . and the xl seems to be more wide than anything else . 
just spend the extra bucks and buy an official one from apple . 
so i don t know what i m going to do with the num_num bags that are left . 
don t let people fool you ,  this case fits the iphone num_num perfectly . 
anyway i recommend this one for its price and quality . 
i put my kitchen appliances through the ringer . 
same money but you don t have to leave your house and you get a much larger color selection . 
i have been missing out !  this thing is so sharp . 
if you are the kind of person that turns on the computer for an hour . 
absolutely horrid; cheaper @ costco if you must . 
it took three years three vets and over twelve hundred dollars spent before success . 
plus i never bought a screen protector that comes with just one sheet !  explains the price lol . 
it is easy to clean ,  but honestly i rarely clean it . 
this flat iron combo curler is not worth the money that i spent for it . 
i own the extire oxo steel line and am pleased with all the products under this line . 
my first draft of this review was also way too long . 
my second mistake was filling the container with too much liquid ,  it took forever to freeze . 
all the songs build on the same words . 
even though there was no mounting hardware included ,  it didn t take my handy husband long to put them up . 
i does smell good but it clumps together and it was definately way too expensive for it s quality . 
hand graters can be a mess to clean ,  especially under the handle . 
i ve been baking for over num_num years; owned a catering business and develop my own recipes oftentimes . 
i did update  how much fun is this toy  from num_num to num_num stars though . 
still ,  if i could give it no stars or click  dislike ,   i would . 
hasn t had to be rebooted yet due to connection issues . 
i kept it though i do not use it . 
the concept was great and it worked very well when it worked . 
it is reversible ,  therefore the two different colored leather pieces have been glued together . 
you have to break it in ,  in other words . 
it does play music from my itouch over fm through my radio and it does charge my itouch . 
i needed num_num as i have so many different utensils and i like to organize them by type . 
the cardboard pleats close shut and this makes the oil have to seek another open pleat to enter . 
the lid is great if you need to store whatever you are making for any length of time . 
the did not a aborb water at all . 
the price was good ,  and came quickly though my prime membership . 
i adjusted the volumes on the ipod and the cassette player . 
i was not at all pleased with the performance of this chopper . 
it really has little to hold one s interest for more than a couple of minutes max . 
there s not much to say about it ,  it s a well stitched quilted fitted cover . 
i have no padding of my own to offset hard soles . 
and i wanted them all to be easy to access . 
i dropped it countless times and my phone was never damaged and the case never broke . 
for my purpose this is the perfect item . 
this is a good hoodie and well made . 
it s very black ,  and it does add volume . 
something s wrong with it . me :  it s just yucky . daughter :  you can have it ,  mom . i had high hopes for these drinks . 
cheap ,  low quality chicom scope with even cheaper ring mounts . 
first of all i m not some raging halo . 
i started using xlear nasal spray a few years ago . 
first ,  and surprising was that they have removeable sole inserts . 
as with any oxo product ,  it is difficult to grasp the outstanding effort put into anything oxo produces . 
we both use the blackberry num_num curve ,  which each use bluetooth version num_extend
great case ,  easy to use and very durable . 
need a cheap car charger and it seems to do the job . 
when i go to remove it ,  it rolls into itself ,  tearing at my hair . 
this time ,  i got to enjoy it for about a month ,  then unfortunately ,  one of the tabs broke . 
she s swapped rubber inserts with friends who have other brands ,  and all theirs have torn . 
they re still here because you can see the damage in the garden from them . 
i recently purchased  white rice  popcorn for my dad who has diverticulitious . 
i love this pan ! original review : my baby girl loves these little waffles . 
although this is made to be a dinner plate; this can be used as a small serving plate . 
however ,  i feel civilization iv is most definitely not an improvement overall . 
it also biodegrades slowly !  these sulphates are generally in toxiccategory ii for skin and category one for the eyes . 
as you reel it in ,  you have to stop and repeat the process . 
i love my sorel slippers ,  but these were just cheaply made and wore out in num_num days . 
avoid the heartache and wasted titme of bad discs . 
but this stuff will fall apart after only a few washings . 
i woke up in the middle of the night with strong heart palpitations ,  threw away the bottle next day . 
it had great potential ,  but every misson feels the same ,  and they all are . 
ghost recon advanced warfighter for pc is a very different game than the num_num version . 
the two are not compatible as the lid will not tighten secure enough that there is no leakage . 
company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this . 
i could tell out of the box ,  this was just what i was looking for . 
lasted for two games ,  during which i was the sole operator . 
have been using it daily since it arrived . 
i easily got all of them except num_extend meaning i couldn t progress past this point . 
the  harvest land  in this game is so small i wonder where all the memory went to . 
they put a pad there to help with this ,  which didn t seem to do anything . 
i mean look ,  spyro was good in his early days ,  but now ,  he s garbage . 
got this with two other products which just came loose in a big box ,  first time for that . 
these are solidly built and will allow you to perfectly pack your espresso in the filter . 
very hard plastic and not that fun to play with at all . 
save yourself some time and money and skip this product . 
i had to purchase a second one of these because i broke the first one . 
a process that takes a couple of minutes . 
i love cheetos and any artificially or naturally enhanced cheese snack . 
this casserole dish is the perfect size and i love having a nice lid . 
the first few we bought were good ,  not great quality ,  but i didn t mind because they were so inexpensive . 
unless you have very small or very large hands it is comfortable to use . 
the hairs have been trimmed to make the shape and it is  scritchy  on your face . 
i have both a square and round pan i use this with . 
and with its ergonomic handle and slim design it fits very nicely in my fridge door . 
i have never had a pleasant experience with the customer support at cuisnart . 
much to my dismay ,  the invisishield was nothing but garbage . 
the smell is wonderful ,  the taste is more like popcorn ,  less like cardboard . 
i ve had it several months and am very glad i chose this one ,  it s a bargain and a keeper . 
so ,  despite him liking it ,  it s just too expensive for how long it lasted . 
the protection is so easy to apply ,  doesn t get pushed up by my speck candyshell case ,  and wipes clean . 
hardly something i would give as a wrapped birthday gift . 
the problem with the acrylic ones i ve found is the tipping factor . 
bought this for use to hold my droid incredible . 
we love that it can go straight from the stove top to the oven . 
our dogs have been on rationed food in order to keep them trim and fit . 
i have to redirect or turn off the air conditioning in my car when making a call . 
it creates heaping folds of foam andturns your coffee into a breve latte . 
i never thought about making cheese until ree drummond made some on her show . 
real annoying . the second issue is what i am deducting num_num stars for though . 
i though it would be faster and easier but it wasn t . 
it seems to be of very good quality in its build . 
awesome for workouts . battery life for music is as advertised ,  about num_num hours . 
this in no way resembles a jerky if that s what you were hoping for . 
i normally sit about num_num degrees off angle from my equipment at about num_num ft away . 
i have smaller bt headsets that last num_num hours longer . 
the only thing that redeems is it is that it s still pretty good in two player . 
may be it will become soft with use and then it should be fine . 
her hair felt coarse and knotty . so .  .  . i tried it on my own shoulder length straight hair with the same result . 
that is right up until one day the record feature stopped working . 
i ve had this screen protector on for a week and i already want to take it off . 
it is the handiest thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips . 
why ?  because i was tired of using the half cup with no handle . 
i have been using one for nearly num_num years . 
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one . 
it keeps it the coffee hot and fresh for hours . 
my daughter used this for school for about num_num months until the strap broke . 
i have num_num bird feeders hanging from poles in my front and back yard . 
spent more time fiddling with this than i did looking at the road . 
it was great for about a week until my num_num month lab got a little piece off . 
to reset it to num_num minutes ,  you must press the button num_num times . 
quickly looked up online what i needed ,  then immediately logged onto amazon and found this product . 
actually ,  i have purchased four of these because i keep giving them away to friends . 
i say this because i must use both hands to move this jug because it is heavy when full . 
if you need a pot with this capacity num_extend qts  buy this one . 
i would even spray pam cooking spray on the bottom and it didn t work . 
more creative than num_extend dont think so !  but still a great product . 
it smells too sweet ,  almost like honey in my opinion ,  and the scent is too strong . 
especially nice for something like jam or sweet pickles because you can rinse it right off . 
i loved see and say as a child ,  and i couldn t wait to get one for my toddler . 
don t waste your time or money on these jeans . 
i detest when snake oil salesmen prey on people who are in pain and desperately seeking help and remedies . 
the main problem with this high chair is that the food goes everywhere but the tray . 
its like that showtime rotisserrie oven ,  you set it and forget it . 
it looked like someone dropped the bag and kicked it around until it was turned into mostly dust . 
this item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it s so good . 
only thing i dont like is the huge lighted logo ,  its just too big and too bright . 
the flavor profile is very different ,  and the bitterness is hard to get past . 
we went to the vet ,  did every test ,  and he s healthy physically . 
it gives you the smooth coverage you want ,  excellent support ,  and you won t even know you are wearing it . 
i think way back when we bought the first one it was more than what i paid now . 
i first used it on my hands and fingers . 
if you use your blender often enough you will break the bottom and run out of seals . 
well built ,  comfortable in the hand and does the job they were made for . 
not worth the wait !  just a plastic piece . too much time for delivery . 
this is what s affordable right now ,  so it has to do . 
i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around . 
i followed the guidance and am grateful for it . 
i gave some to the rest of my family not telling them about the awful taste . 
i was looking for a passive toslink splitter like this ,  but this didn t work at all . 
i am using it for aroma therapy ,  and wondering what else i can do with it . 
the graphics are pretty amazing ,  being that the game is so much like mortal kombat ,  so are the graphics !  . 
not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush . 
i find that the volume can go way too high so i keep it down . 
they were friendly and helpful but nothing solved the problem . one rep suggested using a brand new propane tank . 
in particular ,  the coating on this cookware has been cheapened . 
needless to say ,  she put it in her purse when she got home . 
i threw it out because i can t take alcohol . 
after that you have to pay a subscription . 
the seidio case was to creaky and had enough play in the case to be annoying . 
there s no way this will last as long as claimed . 
that one the clips are not sturdy enough to hold the phone .  .  . the phone is too heavy for it . 
although a little small for my taste ,  the display is sharp and attractive . 
fits perfectly ,  cutouts are plsced where they should be . 
they re awesome because you can put them anywhere and they ll hold like a nail . 
accept no cheap plastic substitute ,  these would be a bargain at twice the price . 
i will still continue to use philosophy products ,  just not this one . 
i ve only charged it once since i bought it . 
and since we have a cat that sheds way too much we decided to get this vaccum . 
i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate . 
i still have privacy screen ,  after num_num months . 
the material is so cheap it should be advertised on late night tv and maybe is . 
it it pretty hardy ,  i haven t broken it yet . 
certainly one of the more widely produced in the us . 
i will update my review after num_num months . 
just reinstall the previous ghost recon and raven shield games . 
all of them are utter garbage ,  not even decent polyester . 
either way ,  i cannot rate this product very highly for what it did to my face . 
why ?  because i recently went back to the wilton brand and could not open the dispenser . 
this a great charging accessory for any usb device ,  particularly as an apple charger replacement . 
i d suggest anyone looking to purchase linksys products look into netgear instead . 
it was under thirty five bucks a week ago ,  and seemed like the right price . 
i tried it for a week with several different calls and locations ,  just never worked . 
when i discovered this product and saw the great reviews ,  i went on and bought it . 
good thing filters for num_num gallon tanks are cheap . 
i might return it ,  but i need a can opener . 
but i have to be honest ,  this is gross .  .  . it feels like i am eating flavored dried sponge . 
instead i would recommend cetaphil gentle cleanser and you will be fine . 
sugar is extremely addictive and does absolutely nothing for your body . 
it does seem to sort of flake off your face after a few hours like another reviewer mentioned . 
i purchased two to mount horizontally under the shelves of my kitchen island . 
i d rather tie a towel around my neck as a cape . 
it has moveable dividers ,  collapsible ,  and is perfect for keeping grocery bags and the like secure in the trunk . 
the constriction on my dog caused him to sit . 
being the first leaves it with some problems which i m sure will get fixed in later versions . 
this is a great product that you can plug your iphone and ipad into at the same time . 
with the rented rug doctor ,  you can take everything apart and clean and i like that aspect . 
also cheaper than going to the grocery store . 
wilton always has good quality and the larger size works nice for puffy sugar cookies . 
what i know for certain is that if you re not a  gadget head  ,  you probably won t like it . 
lee seems to think that the length of men s shorts begins with an num_extend inseam . 
no complaints and my wife loves the color . 
the case fit okay but not attractive at all . 
i m not sure why this grinder got so many mixed reviews . 
as i get hit ,  my health endurance goes down . 
i use it to turn thngs i m frying all the time with no problems . 
these small cookie scoops made perfectly uniform two inch cookies . 
i m pretty sure that it is quite impossible for this to store or leak water in any way . 
voice command is better on this set than other ones i ve tried . 
while it does work for some folks ,  i found it completely inadequate for my needs . 
as far as i can tell ,  the quality of the product seems ok . 
they would flip off or get hung up due to poorly rolling wheels . 
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards . 
i ve now tried the device twice ,  and have found it to be quite effective . 
one thing is the amazingly poor unit a . i . 
get it ,  it s worth the price for sure . 
i expected an improvement in signal strength from my tiny usb direct plugin type . 
there is no warming plate in the unit but it doesn t need one . 
i like the easy of getting my slacks on and off the hanger and the hangers are very sturdy . 
my first suggestion to anyone reading reviews on this product is to keep looking . 
i will say it was not acidic nor bitter .  .  .  . but just not much coffee flavor either . 
i was actually surprised at how quickly this thing ran through the num_num apples that i bought . 
the blue here is quite vivid; it stands out in use and in the bottom of a purse . 
as to how well this case will protect the phone from drops i am not sure . 
things i notice so far : + bluetooth num_extend streaming is solid . 
i use it charge my batteries since my usb port is not an option . 
fasy to keep clean and a real treasure . 
for some reason it worked out terribly for me . 
stopped using it immediately and called cs to let them know because it was still under warranty . 
i would rather buy a dvd with the cut scenes from the game than pay $ for this game . 
amazon does not provide enough information about this press . 
just make sure that you don t misplace the spout stopper . 
yes ,  they worked fine the first time i used them ,  fresh out of the package . 
multiplayer is just as bad ,  though thankfully not worse . 
i was bored after the first num_num minutes . 
guess i should gotten one of those again ,  but serves me right for being a cheap skate . 
i loved the food for my cats as you can read below . 
i received them as a christmas present and i love them . 
th product features and editorial review spell germany as the origin of manufacture . 
it didn t work for me hopefully other people will have better luck . 
flavor :  it has some tangy notes ,  and overall not bad . 
mine is a piece of junk ,  as far as i am concerned . 
it did what it was supposed to do . 
would have been alot nicer if it simply threaded in with the correct alignment . 
 :   just never ,  ever ,  use soap on cast iron . 
put num_num quart of water into the machine . 
probably because this is an aluminum shell you re wrapping around the phone ,  makes sense . 
this keeps the cord out of the way and above the board . 
if you do order this product ,  hang on to the instructions to figure out how to change battery . 
it is best to invest in a good set of makeup brushes . 
other reviews had written that this product was not a brushed steel ,  but was instead a shiny finish . 
i use is for more than deep frying . 
i am only giving this item num_num stars because of the absurd price . 
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking . 
this does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself . 
it was the finger next to his hole finger . 
it s almost like putting the phone into a high end pair of socks . 
i can t imagine one of these racks ever collapsing with an item on top of it . 
it almost fit ,  but not enough to snap completely together and fit . 
we are ice cream lovers and fussy about the quality of ice cream . 
also these attachment pieces are very easy to clean . 
add enough water to get a nice dough consistency and roll into a log shape . 
i wanted a mini processor that would allow me to add ingredients at it chopped . 
after taking one bite from the thinkthin creamy peanut butter bar ,  i think they were doing me a favor . 
only negative was delifery was num_num days late . 
it did seem harder to rinse off than other scrubs i ve used ,  even other neutrogena products . 
i just received a replacement bb curve from verizon . 
oh ,  and the battery life is pretty decent . 
used to to monitor my computer s power consumption and keep the electric bill down . 
i consumed this expensive probiotic few months ago religiously after seeing so many positive reviews . 
it was fairly consistent and overall i was happy with the function ,  if not the form . 
i dropped phone once and the case held up perfectly . 
there is no menu selection for find free books . 
i must say that this is truly a great product for your grating and zesting needs . 
the divider tray is a shallow ,  flimsy piece of plastic that is only about a half inch deep . 
i ve had this for a bout a week now and have made about num_num cups of coffee . 
i will always have slight pain ,  no matter what . 
we tried to go economically ,  but in the world of garlic presses ,  you get what you pay for . 
the material that it is made of is like a dirt magnet . 
however a couple hours after taking this vitamin i would have a stomachache for several hours . 
i instructed my children to be gentle ,  and supervised them at all times . 
it works for maybe a few minutes and wears off quickly . 
the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was pathetic . 
as other reviewers have noted ,  the corners of the box are very hard to clean . 
so kuhn rikon leads you to believe that this is high quality stainless steel whisk made in switzerland . 
waste of money ,  waste of time ,  waste of blood . 
i installed this on a horizantaly sliding window . 
this case is far from what i expected . 
love this mixer ,  wasn t near as loud as some were saying . 
this bookcase ,  once assembled is sturdy and solid ,  which is what i wanted . 
this is spectacularly bad because ,  without the filter ,  the pan clogs and doesn t drain . 
i love soda probably more than i should and one of my favorite flavors for it is cherry . 
these wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job . 
i could gently run my fingers through my hair and be left with a handful of hair . 
it makes it easy and neat to store and access all of your scarves . 
glad i went for this one over some of the less expensive ones . 
cleans up nice and cooks waffles in a reasonable amount of time . 
short blades and longer handles give you the leverage you need for tough cutting . 
and it s much much cheaper than getting it at the cusinart parts site . 
then into my phone and it chargers my phone . 
great dutch oven ,  works well and fun to use on camping trips . 
the otterbox defender series is by far the best available . 
too bulky and there are better products out there in single units . 
does not give me any confidence in buying any of the discovery kids toys . 
this case looks so great on the phone ,  and protects it very well from drops . 
this turner has worked well for the last few years . 
i have very soft skin so my beard comes in light at some parts under my neck . 
i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water . 
old grandson loves all things that have to do with construction . 
but i like the phone to be up higher on the windshield . recommended . 
maybe a num_extend old girl could wear it . 
heavy ,  patterned glass ,  and very classy looking on the table . 
i have not been able to stop using it . 
so please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price . 
held a charge for a better part of the day ,  now i cant get more num_num hours . 
i haven t seen any improvement yet aside from the money that i am missing . 
soe decided to push it to live a whole num_num weeks sooner than that . 
it s not overpowering ,  it is not like perfume . 
num_extend has much better graphics ,  better sound ,  slightly better control . 
however ,  slicing up tons of veggies can be quite time consuming . 
but the buttons have stopped working ,  no speaker ,  no caller id ,  nothing in the buttons work . 
i mainly use my blentec now but haven t sold the vitamix yet . 
not a problem at all . the case does make a large phone even larger . 
also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head . 
claritin used to be the best thing around . 
it really is like they didn t take anything at all . 
most of us know the importance of sharp knives for proper food preparation and gracious serving . 
i love the fact i can be connected to my phone and computer at the same time . 
i was glad to see it was still available . 
i tried everything short of breaking the thing open . 
very easy to put on ,  no bubbles whatsoever . 
this the first anolon product that i ve bought but i will be buying more . 
i can see i will be using it a lot . 
i was concerned for the price that these measuring cups would be flimsy . 
the complication is the heft of the phone . 
i have owned it for two years and it is a work horse . 
they need a strap to hold them on and could use to be more durable . 
that said ,  i really love this little tool and haven t had any problems with it at all . 
other reviews seemed more positive ,  but i just gave mine away . 
i did not even bother to mention this initially ,  because quite frankly ,  i don t see the point . 
i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven . 
i dumped all num_num screen protectors in the trash bin . 
i bought the lowest priced model more to test the brand than anything else . 
you place all the ingredients into the bread maker . 
my dish feels very solid to the touch . 
i am just not sure what size to order and there are better options out there . 
it is very easy to operate and the handle is broad; easy to hold onto . 
the front of the case meets the glass seamlessly making it look like part of the phone . 
and here i thought that i finally found a good ,  heatlhy ,  wholesome pet treat for my dog . 
this is the first french press i have owned ,  and bought ss due to fear of glass breaking . 
i connected to an old wallmart num_extend amp rated at num_num watts peak and tuned with a dmm . 
this is definitely not the case with the num_extend
i don t know how i ever managed without this handy devise . 
this is a great grill ,  for single ,  couples ,  or families . 
we also put things like our small shovel ,  empty watering can ,  and bag of soil on the bottom shelves . 
but these knives are well worth their price . 
as a result ,  when talking on the phone and working you can t tilt your head down . 
i used this product to ensure my employees wouldn t be reading my email or texts messages over my shoulder . 
its very ackward case and if you like to listen to music with your headset forget it . 
the loops stop any accidently lost or intentional disappearance . 
there is nothing special about this product ,  it might as well been from the dollar store . 
i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking . 
we usually run it on low and it is relatively quite . 
first ,  i was totally shocked by how much floor space it takes up . 
indeed ,  the difficulty is actually harder than many games i ve played with better control schemes . 
it s a very good basic headset for people who don t need anything fancy . 
to top it off ,  they broke after two days . spend $ on a usable pair of headphones . 
i would suggest buying num_num gallon ziploc bags and putting them in a backpack over using this product . 
i was so excited about this product .  .  . until i got it home . 
it charges my phone very quickly and to full % battery . 
i like these so much for everyday use ,  i am buying anoter set for my vacation home . 
well worth the money ,  wouldn t want to be without it . 
i will never have a phone without an otterbox again . 
then i thought something was wrong with my car . 
no more expensive corkscrews for me !  get this ,  you will not be disappointed . 
that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating . 
the num_extend display is covered with slightly curved gorilla glass that both looks and feels great . 
it has a nice clean look to it ,  is well balanced and has a good pump action . 
because it s made of cast iron ,  scorching is minimized . 
i bought one of those mentioned before and was really disappointed in the results i got . 
out went the four year old ,  used about four dozen times ,  out of warranty ,  krups panini grill . 
does this ever happen to the cpu ?  rarely . 
i imagine it will make soups even better than the old one as well . 
i have not used this very many times due to the extreme tangling it causes . 
the fit is perfect ,  the pocket in front is useful and i love the colors . 
like all poppers of this type it is simple to use and does a good job . 
and i like the fact that it has folding prongs ,  which prevents them from breaking like my former one . 
very nice unit ,  easy to assemble and operate . 
i would not buy this again in the future . 
the construction is solid ,  and the overall look is attractive . the cap is of course a convenient jigger  measuring cup  . 
crayola makes the best crayons ,  don t get me wrong . 
perhaps it won t rust ,  but upclose it looks a little cheesey . 
at least amazon is good on returns  and thank you to customer service  . 
it is also not grinding long enough to generate sufficient heat to alter taste to me . 
simple !  does the job it was intended for . 
so i just thought maybe it ll help keep my acne away . 
i ve been using this for months ,  and like it very much . 
i even used extra gloss over the top to help but it was just to strong for my lips . 
let me be clear ,  i returned it because i don t think it is made of safe material . 
its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones . 
infact ,  i just had a request from a friend to order num_num for herself and num_num for her friends . 
i bought these for my toddler after reading a glowing review in a parenting magazine . 
it s a peppy pink ,  which is distinctive and makes my phone stand apart . 
it just tasted very blah to me and even my num_num year daughter !  . 
i bought a pack of these socks in xl for our son ,  who wears a num_num shoe . 
my dog has started to become anxious at bedtime . 
it works as advertised so i m happy !   :   . 
item arrived in num_num days in bulk packaging exactly like j . 
for the size ,  weight and price it is really worth it . 
i just flipped the pan over ,  and there they were . 
my original review gave this product num_num stars but i just knocked that down to num_num stars . 
i did not know that the mark iii i as getting had grips that cannot be removed . 
it just works !  there are two usb outlets ,  and they provide one micro usb cable . 
just beware of the different method of cleaning for these iron skillets or an iron cook items . 
so after two months of use ,  working in it . 
once the vent starts hissing ,  i let it hiss for about num_num more minutes . 
it holds the charge like when my phone was brand new . 
i would recommend this case to my friends . 
nothing . it has a fragrance that is strong enough for those in the general area to smell ,  but not overpowering . 
i don t know why it has all the good reviews . 
makes perfectly shaped loaves with nice crispy crust ,  just like your local bakery . 
it is a bit pricey but ,  no bag purchase helps with savings over the long haul . 
the same panel buttons are there but in a better placement . 
there were other vegetables included ,  but you really couldn t taste them . 
maybe for a larger breed dog ,  but not for small puppies with little mouths . 
i thought the company produced good products ,  but i was mistaken when i bought this item . 
if you only hook up one or two things ,  they don t get more power . 
all my testing proves the same . hope that helps . 
all in all ,  though ,  happy with the product . 
the quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less . 
it works in less than a second and it s completely done !  i wish i had the patent on it !  . 
what a shame ,  because all those years ago when i traveled internationally ,  nokia was a reliable phone to have . 
finish is great ,  and it makes great french toast . 
i ll be buying another one so i can have separate pans for meat and bread . 
if you re into making your own pizza from scratch ,  you know that without help ,  you ll get soggy pizza crust . 
i bought this for my num_num month old daughter ,  and it isn t a very good toy . 
by the time i was done ,  it was too loose and of course can t return it . 
i would definitely not have ordered it if i had known how much trouble it would be to use . 
i used this along with another similar product ,  for over num_num months . 
needless to say ,  i decided to just by a lamaze maternity bra for $
i don t think the saying  you get what you pay  . 
this is a cheap trackball mouse and not as good as the microsoft trackball mouse that costs much more . 
if you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that specialize in that category . 
enfamil infant is characterized by choline and dha . 
you dont get so much sand with this . 
i tried playing the dvd in num_num different slots in the carousel and had the same exact problem . 
they get into the corners as described and are flexible yet firm . 
if you get these just be a bit careful . 
hope this lasts longer than my last grinder so can buy as a gift . 
and in each town ,  you have to find the stupid pieces and rebuild the towns ,  then repeat the process . 
we buy them as gifts for our baking friends ,  too ,  and they love them . 
i have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed . 
it s not a large pan and i think that is one of the reasons i like it so well . 
with grandchildren ,  this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional . 
it s also a good size for a family of num_extend
it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer . 
i don t need this much protection every day ,  but at the airport ,  geocaching ,  etc . 
if you cross the line ,  you lose life every num_num seconds or something like that . 
it worked for maybe num_num months then died . 
i was just looking for something cheaper than the gelish harmony acetone remover so i tried this . 
i could not tell a difference at all . 
i have been using this grill for num_num years . 
the only real drawback to them are they simply won t fit into a pocket . 
i like the oster steamer ,  it does everything it claim to do . 
i would not suggest this on black iphones . 
this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony . 
problem with returns when you pay cash is no matter how long you ve been shopping here . 
my goof to not research this brand more . 
it is close to the old one i had for years . 
i found these patches very hard to put on . 
several packets of the pellets will be needed to fill the litterbox with an adequate bed . 
the hash browns and eggs were more like a paste then even the smallest chunks . 
one to another company and two to amazon . com . 
in other words ,  i rather expected this might quickly become mommy s project . 
these are great !  !  !  i use them for my usb drives . 
i ve not been terribly impressed with this box . 
i gave this one star because of the lack of an ingredients list . amazonl ,  . 
le creuset casts these cooking vessels from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once . 
first of all ,  i got really impressed with the ratings and reviews this game got . 
i will add an update if i ever figure it out . 
i tried hiding them in her food and in her treats . 
she didn t like the handle of this one at all . 
her phrases are limited ,  and could be more original ,  imo ,  for the price . 
the knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle . 
i m very happy with this wok !  it takes some time to get the factory coating off ,  but be patient . 
well it made it worse like a rubber band texture . 
i ll just stick with a good mayo and skip the bacon . 
these were so cheap ,  i could mess up twice and still have an extra after i did num_num phones . 
my problem is i don t use it very often .  .  . i use smaller ones and i forget i have it . 
thank heaven the operation is intuitive because there are no instructions . 
unless your freezer is in the kitchen or living room ,  you ll never hear it . 
peach ,  really ?  sorry ,  it doesn t really taste like any peach i ve had . 
the build is right ,  the buttons on the phone are right ,  its just a nice solid package . 
i thought i was over charged once it was returned . 
also ,  as other reviewers have stated ,  the straps can really rub a raw spot on your skin . 
i figured that this would be a good move ,  seeing how natural it is compared to other products . 
i think the sensor is reading carpet fibers its sucking up as dirt . 
i bought them and find them pretty annoying . 
for example ,  comparing wii sports tennis to wii play table tennis is night and day . 
called cables to go and they recommended trying a replacement ,  which i will obtain through amazon . 
after all the great reviews i thought i d give this a try . 
unfortunately this product did not do much for me . 
no problems with this and worked with many devices . 
you get what you pay for i guess . 
nikon usually puts out a quality product ,  but this eyepiece magnifier is not one of them . 
it might work for all purpose flour ,  which has less gluten . 
either you will like it ,  or you won t . 
really strong ghosting ,  any screen object had three or four echoes beside it . 
i keep worrying that they will get stuck in some body cavity and cause a problem . 
puts together very easily and does what it s said it would . 
it is also very discrete if you don t want your nails to look polished . 
i really like how this counter protector curves over the edge of the counter . 
its dimensions are num_extend x num_extend x num_extend  smaller than a deck of cards  . 
in my experience ,  they are a constant source of problems . 
i m using these with num_extend to deliver power to num_extend cctv and ip cameras . 
if you re looking at replacing your older blackberry devices ,  this is the one you need to get . 
trash cans are pretty unexciting ,  but this one is awfully nice . 
much better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead . 
i ll keep trying .  .  . if not ,  it s going on ebay ;  . 
it is not difficult to clean or assemble . 
this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick . 
why can t a hair dryer just be something that dries my hair ?  . 
disappointed as i expected to received candy that would last a long time . 
i read the reviews about this garlic press and decided it was the one i wanted . 
the waist cords are over a foot long after being taken in . 
however ,  some people may find the border of the case may interfere with using the touch screen . 
so ,  this car looks cool and all but its not that great . 
it is hard to beleive that a big name company like philips would totally ignore their customer . 
then ,  put some armor all original on there and you re good to go for way longer than two weeks . 
i played it for aboout num_num min and feel like i wanna take it back already . 
i have no idea if it s me or this product doing . 
otherwise ,  they fall off your head at the slightest lean or tilt . 
maybe i should get that for cheaper . i accidently bought large ,  ooh boy is it; like ,  windshield sun reflector size . 
i can hear the caller clearly ,  vice versa . 
the puzzles are somewhat more simple ,  but also more difficult at certain points . 
after removing the cap i found moisture had made its way into the components inside ,  under the cap . 
just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake . 
so what do you have to lose ?  after all ,  i am happily keeping mine . 
and that s all i can think of right now . anyway ,  on to master of orion num_extend
i got mine from smart bargains who told me i had no recourse other than to contact cuisinart . 
but i will say this ,  i will not buy this particular product again . 
try it once and you won t think it s stupid . 
only issue is the blue light it becomes a annoying after a while . 
as long as it doesn t break ,  it s performance and comfortable design make this an excellent choice . 
i loved it so much that i wanted to buy another one for a different room . 
we have tried a few recipes and had fun with them . 
it was supposed to be a complete toy . 
well ,  i was excited to play this ,  but unfortunately ,  i wasn t able to finish the game . 
take the whole thing out in the sink . 
nevertheless ,  the smell lasts for num_num or num_num minutes tops . 
this salad spinner is durable and easy to use . 
good that they are from usa and not china !  . 
i have to agree with another reviewer that this cloth is almost identical to those you find in walmart . 
so far i am not at all happy . 
if it still lasts for num_num hours in num_num years time then it would be a good buy . 
i also had tingling in my mouth and soreness in my throat ,  which was distressing . 
i purchased them and when they arrived they were torn . 
i wouldn t trade them but this is a great knife for the price . 
the sound quality is very good ,  the controls are intuitive ,  and it is comfortable . 
it s very easy to use and very dependable . 
no flexing i ve ever seen from the handles no matter how hard i squeeze . 
so for a very reasonable cost ,  this model suits me just fine !  !  . 
quite tasteless and they make you order so many . 
it moves plenty of air ,  oscillating between two rooms . 
i had another silicone case on it and sadly the screen  which was left entirely exposed  got super wet . 
i want to get one for each of my kids so they can have fresh natural popcorn too !  . 
it has carbonated water ,  fruit juice ,  some natural flavors and colors ,  and vitamin c . 
use espresso grinds and turns out great didn t find that the grinds get through !  would recommend . 
camera fell of it after a few uses . 
i will never again purchase another game where this is a requirement . 
i haven t used extensively yet and therefor it has not been through the dishwasher very many times . 
i ve owned this crock pot for several years . 
really ,  it all does look nice graphically wise . 
it only worked a couple of times ,  i bought it to calibrate my oven . 
benriners come in num_num sizes  this is the smallest  and replacement blades are readily available . 
i have listened to this on both ends as the sender and receiver and it s nothing shy of fantastic . 
its very similar to that type of style . 
i will say that these are a lot stronger than the old ones i had . 
i have enjoyed my previous prodyne cheese slicer ,  this adds the cracker well . 
if you want loud get the cdn num_extend count down big digit timer . 
might have been nice ,  but just went over my cheeks . 
usually ,  i reapply my clarins or donna karen cashemere after half of a day . 
the dawn worked well as i saw a lot of dead fleas in the water going down the drain . 
then i used the attachemnts on my furniture and the water was gray . 
i think this case is a very nice phone case . 
the shape of the grains makes all the difference . 
i especially liked the instructions to spray the liquid on your fingers to keep the screen protector from sticking . 
also ,  do not use on glass top rangesoverall thoughtsfor the price ,  the presto canner is worth a look . 
i ve had this clothes rack for almost two years now and it hasn t failed me once . 
first ,  without the extension they are very short . 
i then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction ,  none . 
i bought chicken and brown rice last year and it was alright ,  not super impressive . 
they have a medium pile lining that has more of a stiffer polyester feel . 
anker is a fine product though i d never heard of it . 
this as well as their rice cooker which i ve had for a decade have become indispensible for me . 
my dog broke this in the first num_num min of me giving him the toy . 
the unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck . 
every couple days . the quality and filling hassles didn t stop my trying to use it ,  though . 
the item was what i was looking for and arrived exactly as described . 
nightwolf s friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers . 
buy it . i want to leave this as a num_num star review as operationally it is working perfectly . 
it s too bad because they look like they would keep my ears warm . 
the braun has it all . this is my second programmable flavorselect . 
if it doesn t ,  the player sorts the files in an album in alphabetical order . 
i had the num_num express music and when this new version came out i decided to upgrade . 
i would definitely recommend this for a cute case . 
but the back side looks nice as well . 
these salmons are in water not vegetable oil . 
i bought three of these units to place in our home . 
and that would be what you would need . 
the measuring cup and pin are perfect and i always get the most perfect eggs now . 
these break often but the kids love them ,  if only they would keep working . 
it works fine and the coffee is just as great !  . 
i bought this little gadget after my iphone ran out of juice on a trip . 
its not worth purchasing if you re looking for a quick ,  almost expensive ,  fix . 
it basically picks up what is directly in front of it . 
pretty much all i ask for in a grinder . 
the rack is very well made and the hooks can be moved to fit different sizes . 
it s a very good quality at a reasonalbe price . 
i need a phone that gets reception on the train and works in my high rise offie building . 
just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied . 
when you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut . 
i won t be buying any more in the future . 
i hated the color that was sent to me ,  pale chalky beige . 
that s not what it felt like with the original gel adhesive . 
this knife sharpener more than met our expectations . 
it would work very well ,  if the human body did not have shoulders ,  that is . 
this heavy weight  tall  pot along with cooking contents is estimated to weigh over num_num lbs . 
i tried multiple outlets and tried resetting it using the red button ,  but it still did not heat up . 
the bags aren t resealable and the directions are for num_num to num_num gallon urns .  .  . obviously a restaurant supply item . 
i cook for two people and this food processor is just the right size for that . 
the radtach procable num_num inch dock extender works only part way . 
she didn t like the flavor at all ,  and i found them to be way too sweet . 
if you want to comfortably fry two eggs ,  best to order the num_num inch pan . 
really cool design ,  and the hard plastic piece doesn t add any thickness over what the soft rubber case provides . 
why ,  because they never sounded very good ,  so i stuck with a wired headset . until ,  the new jawbone . 
because it is definitely not worth full price . 
i really like this case !  !  it does not pick up lint like some of the other rubberized cases . 
i would not recommend this item for dogs who chew . 
after all these years ,  these are still the best plates you can buy for next to nothing . 
he was always complaining that he was sick because the house was too dry in the winter . 
it has been over an hour and my hair still feels damp in some areas . 
it s a shame i can t explore them .  .  . the party mode is horrible too . 
first ,  when the level is picked ,  it will take like a minute or even more to load . 
this is the worst game i have come across in a long time . 
the only drawback is that i put it in the dishwasher ,  several times . 
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much smaller . 
it s solid stainless ,  so i don t see how you could go wrong there . 
my data throughput was about num_extend typically ,  with num_extend on a really good day . 
unfortunately i m not sure what all the five star reviews are for . 
it is too bad because the ingredients looked to be quality . 
i like everything about this deep fryer ,  except for the fact that it gets too hot . 
buy this knife sharpener if you want sharpening your knives to be highly skilled labor . 
i wore this product today for a few hours today . 
perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works . 
the feel of the wheel is nice and i like the side scrolling feature . 
a definite num_extend for how they handled this . 
the children enjoy having their own bags of popcorn as they watch a movie chosen for that night . 
am very disappointed that i still can t wear my shoes !  . 
and i have tried a lot of them . 
i give it five stars for making eating good so easy !  . 
it didn t fit in my bathtub ,  which is a standard size . 
instead of standing in front of the open drawer yelling ,   where s the lemon juicer !   . 
there are only two of us so this size is perfect for saving dinner size portions . 
we boiled our old stove top tea kettle dry a couple times and got worried about fire danger . 
also ,  the backstage areas that you have to wrestle in are smaller than the wrestling ring itself . 
but at the same time ,  you get what you pay for because it s also pretty cheap . 
and it doesn t ding to tell you when that happens ,  so you better keep an eye on it . 
we plugged in an extra headset laying around the house . 
this case looks nice but that s about it . 
i can t believe how strong this little guy is . 
it takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it . 
there are num_num sheets in a set ,  so you can put them around the kitchen within easy reach . 
the daily challenge around here is keeping the cat fur to a minimum . 
people should do more research before they put stuff in their bodies ! hey crusoe . 
then i ll buy out all the good game companies and turn them into mainstream crap . 
despite the port breaking it gets num_extend stars . 
synching is simple ,  with no passwords or codes required . 
if you love french pressed coffee ,  this is definitely the way to go !  . 
i contacted q cell and they replaced the back cover . 
i hope it will be a better choice . 
it s heavy and a pain to move around  which you have to do to get the  cartridge  out . 
wow im impressed with this device !  how useful it is . 
i love that it uses natural ingredients but it was ineffective on my skin . 
so ,  i had to get a little of everything to see what was what . 
however ,  my speakers have finally started to distort again and i can t handle buying another $ part . 
after a num_extend try i received the same product . 
folks ,  don t do that; the plunger exerts pressure that has to be released somewhere . 
i used a metal pie pan and a metal cake pan to put water out for them . 
a gas cooktop would be worse and a smooth cooktop probably much better . 
i can just leave it cool down in the jug then store it and pour from it as well . 
i don t use it and it s in a junk drawer somewhere waiting the next purge to goodwill . 
i love the floral design and the colors . 
they seem like they are stale ,  like old candy gets ,  but the sell by date is still good . 
it never reaches  reasonable  looking sharp photos and ultimately fails in every catagory ,  from color to chromatic abberation . 
very impressed than within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection . 
most products are for dandruff caused by dry scalp . 
we often cook sausages ,  hot dogs and hamburgers in it as well . 
while the first couple of bites were okay ,  the rest of the meal was a let down . 
snug fit ,  with all the buttons and holes perfectly aligned . 
yes ,  it is plastic ,  but not cheap plastic . 
over and over  and over and over  again . 
this product was not in functioning condition when delivered . 
the steering column does not fit snug . my son is num_num and has been enjoying it for the most part . 
i m sorry that happened because buying it from amazon would have been a better experience . 
i use this with afresh to clean my cook top . 
this is a worthless item that makes no sense at all . 
worked best on older new england house with narrow staircase . 
this bra didn t fit ,  was too tight and was a horrible mess . 
the can is a good size to hold trash .  .  . not too big or too small . 
you do need a scrubby to clean it with as there s no teflon but it s totally worth it . 
doesn t get stuck on the rod like some non rollers do . 
might work for others ,  didn t work for me . 
not to mention it did not fit my screen completely . 
i thought that all of the possibilities would be awesome . 
i have tried pretty much every bluetooth device on the market ,  literally a dozen ,  or more . 
i made flour tortillas that night for our mexican burrito dinner . 
it was all potatoes and had very little clam flavor . 
the more you use it ,  the more seasoned it becomes and the better it performs . 
i m really happy with this screen protector because it was easy to peel back up and reapply . 
taking it out of the box i found the design to be awkward . 
i purchased this jawbone hd as a replacement for an older jawbone thinker . 
bottled lemon or lime juice will really add an obvious plastic taste to something as clean tasting as sorbet . 
the grill surface is easier to clean than our other grills . 
you either have to dial for them ,  or hand them the users manual . 
luckily i was able to slip the button back inside and its been working for a while . 
the case zipper shuts with a flap that covers the zipped part . 
due to it s small footprint it doesn t take much room and is easy to store . 
the only two minor problems i have with this one is what another reviewer wrote . 
the first time i used the card in a digital camera ,  it corrupted the last half of the images . 
i bought this coffee press in num_extend and it has been in use everyday for my morning ritual . 
i feel like i have a new phone . 
it grinds it to a powder in just a couple of seconds . 
the upholstery tool does an admirable job on carpeting under ,  say ,  a bed that can t be moved . 
plus its from amazon and amazon wouldn t put their name on crap . 
i reported it havent heard a word about it . 
the only way to set the ball in the strike zone is to try and pitch it high . 
this plot twist is like something m night shamalan would come up with while drunk . 
he s heavy and stable enough to not tip over when it s windy . 
another thing i really like is that it does not have rivets . 
he read every amazon . com review as well as the zojirushi website . 
fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x . 
maybe i got a bad batch ?  won t take the chance again though . 
i was hoping for a bit better than this from amazon . 
that way ,  the lotion won t go to waste ,  and i can wash off the scent with my morning shower . 
i had been looking for a ball whisk since seeing alton brown use one on good eats . 
it was a great purchase for my daughter s i phone num_num her favorite color is blue . 
this case is cute however the is the only good thing about it . 
what designer invented this ?  ?  now ,  it only cost me $ and replacing it has been free . 
i ve come to the conclusion that i ve wasted my money . 
my slim daughter with her slim iphone cover laughed when she saw my new otterbox iphone armor . 
i would not recomend this for a tmobile ,  mytouch phone to anyone . 
i admit i did put hours into this game being the hugh mortal kombat fan that i am . 
the good pieces that i manages to salvage the birds refuse to touch . 
he enjoys this toy ,  but can get the treats out fairly quickly . 
i had no smoke though ,  and i wasn t worried about the mixer at all . 
turning the input level up does help but that defeats the purpose of the earphones  having a silent tv  . 
the lights are pretty bright but i have no use for it since i can t mount it nicely . 
other than that ,  this coffee machine is easy to use and to clean . 
like how many times you face the nazgul and how easily they are beaten . 
i ordered num_num and find this to be a hugh mistake . 
better yet i could loose some weight and get back in to a dozen pair from years ago . 
if you are grinding dry items ,  it should be ok . 
i plan to experiment with using a spatula or something else that will open this efficiently and safely . 
i have to say that it was money well spent . 
the temp change was noticeable very quickly ,  you get really cold if you are near this thing on high . 
it does a better job although the cat still gets upset ,  just doesn t freak out from surroundings . 
i have used this several times for roasting sunflower seeds and it is functional and gets the job done . 
the entire thing fits in the palm of my child s hand . 
we understood that we should give this a num_num to num_num night test run at minimum . 
it stores in a really small place and is built to last . 
i ordered these from amazon since i could find them nowhere in my area . 
it s the only knife i have in my kitchen and it serves all my purposes extremely well !  . 
so what it comes down to is that u get what u paid for . 
the reviews for this product were mostly positive and this is the reason for buying this handheld deep cleaner . 
the pee doesn t seem to smell either . the poo stays on top with the litter . 
unfortunately ,  he tore off the covering on this toy in num_num minutes !  don t bother with it . 
also they did not honor the warranty because i did not buy it directly for the mfg . 
for example ,  for  heavy duty  tasks like cutting through a chunk of frozen meat etc . 
one is for coffee ,  one for spices and one is for nuts and seeds . 
this was the first gluten free product i tried followed by a sandwich with brown rice bread . 
this year ,  with the $ price ,  there was no question !  i was staying with num_extend
my bag isn t very big and neither is the bike rack it sits on . 
saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil . 
what a change in my life this will make . 
not bad for what you pay ,  but i d rather spend num_extend the $ and have perfect . 
i finally bought one of these for myself ,  i should ve done it long time ago . 
dial colors hold up well ,  however the needle is no longer red ,  turned dark over time . 
the sound is also very surprising for the price and is enough for me . 
this is the second one of these i have purchased . 
it doesn t require genius to get this unit operating . 
i just can t recommend a curling wand that is practically guaranteed to burn you . including a glove is thoughtful . 
i guess i read a bunch of reviews talking about the belgian likeness ,  i thought thats what it was . 
in it s expanded position ,  it is very comfortable to hold and use in my hand . 
at work ,  especially ,  i only need an id and credit card so this case is perfect for my purposes . 
works num_extend cups is perfect for husband and i ,  never been sorry for purchase . 
i estimate that four trips were made to empty and refill the water compartments . 
the balm is crap more like a vaseline stick . 
i guess it fails in the truth department on its advertising . 
if you have a finicky cat ,  you might want to try the other flavor . 
in this case ,  it s a big disappointment for num_extend
carrots will leave a big orange smear on the surface . 
i bought this product for feeding my num_num persian cats while on vacation . 
a heroic wolf died saving a village ,  and now the village is surrounded by evil once again . 
so that would mean press one ,  move ,  press one ,  two ,  three ,  four five . 
it is a poor performer when it comes to odor retention and clumping . 
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were very clear . 
when we opened the box ,  we discovered that this has a nonstick coating . 
do not buy this product ! the photos are horribly ,  horribly misleading . 
once the lid closes ,  the smell goes away . 
it s not as bulky feel as the other cases available . 
it simply gets all the juice from the fruit and has a cup that is the correct premeasured size . 
still it is a fun learning experience and so far so good . 
this is the second bottle i have purchased and honestly i see no noticeable difference . 
it was just what i expected it to be . 
i did not have what i felt were unrealistic expectations of this device . 
several times already because the machine kept loosing suction . we returned the second hoover and purchased the dyson . 
it adds size o an already pretty big system . 
my wife despises window fans usually and she loves this thing too . 
i purchased the frieling to replace a glass bodum press that broke . 
it works as expected and is just the right size for the camper . 
armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like homeworld or even starcraft . 
i have been a devoted zyliss chopper fan ever since i bought my first one in num_extend
a meeting my phone is in the bag charging . 
they were huge ,  yet the same size in the leather is tight . 
white in the refrigerator a couple of days longer . 
they also make noise if you happen to touch one against the other . 
however ,  keep in mind that looking at the picture you may think it works also for bottles . 
it worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely . 
size s in black fits and feels great ,  but the print combo was tighter and not at all flattering . 
not only has this piece performed flawlessly ,  but the entire set i received has too . 
the demo offered clean graphics and quick gameplay ,  though it was hampered by an incredibly simplistic story . 
i cant believe i wasted num_num dollars on this doll when i could have gotten a better liv doll . 
it seems highly recommended to completely discharge a battery prior to recharging  though this can be debated  . 
pricing was about what i expected to paycons :  bose only wants their customers buying their products . 
i love cooking and you need sharp knives when cooking . 
spend the extra bucks and get the chopat knee bands . 
this item works just as i thought it would . 
everytime there is a  brownout  or  power flicker  the battery backup does not engage and the computer just resets . 
unfortunately ,  not my blackberry nor my cell phone . 
i contacted the seller and was given a refund . 
works no better than the one that came with the tuner i purchased it for . 
the inside diameter is roughly num_num   x num_num   ,  in other words ,  very useable . 
it s environmentally friendlier than the plastic baggies foodsaver sells ,  and more cost effective . 
it comes at a good price and appears to be well made . 
oh well ,  say goodbye to your problem with the help of this new trent icarrier num_extend
the graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version . 
i had also informed the organix company of my dissatisfaction but no response on their part . 
the granite on the inside is unfinished and has a powdery residue ,  likely the stone . 
my fiance tried ,  too ,  but couldn t get the attachment to fit ,  either . 
what happens :  programs on the bionic that are moved to the sd card disappear . 
i used it once ,  and only then did i notice that the last ingredient listed is ovary . 
i like the concept and the design ,  but this product fell short of my expectations . 
no support ,  itchy fabric ,  and doesn t hold a good shape . 
i have since replaced my regular bike seat with a gel seat which i prefer and is very comfortable . 
i particularly like turning it on before i leave for work and returning to freshly vacuumed rooms . 
these imperfections cannot be seen from the viewing angle and they  heal  over time . 
it was almost like pokemon yellow in the fighting system . 
i bought this when i bought the bread maker to make slicing easier and it does . 
it does this to a very significant degree and is extremely uncomfortable to wear . 
the rubberized bottom and comfortable handle on this bowl make it a pleasure to use . 
i read all the reviews and decided on this one . 
they are very light weight  you may not like that  and they are quite sharp . 
of course the german s call this sort of idea good engineering . 
these work well ,  and the one that fits bottles comes in handy too . 
i also love that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill . 
there must be an engineering issue with the motor of the toy . 
by the way ,  i read here so often about not using soap to wash your cast iron . 
we have used ours at least a couple of hundred times . 
my friend loaned me a wilton angel food pan which she had it from way back when . 
i also found the carry handle a great idea that i wish all similar shaped counter top appliances had . 
these screen protectors ,  last me a month or num_num each ,  and i use my iphone like a mad man . 
however ,  if you have the money to buy a better one ,  do it . 
i was able to reuse what i had ,  but that just isn t what you always want to do . 
a must have if you have one of the older foodsavers . 
the quality is declined quickly by heat exposure . 
this is held all together on clear glue or something and my everything fell off . 
i may even give some as gifts this holiday season . 
might have been some rain storms or whatnot ,  but definitely flimsy . roger . 
the finer the setting ,  the longer it takes . 
why get yet another accessory to clean ,  or lose ?  i ruined my previous mr . 
i use these reviews so heavily that i want to give back . 
should have a wider design for different foods . 
its actually a little better than the filter that came with the unit . 
the main flavor to come through is cinnamon and the slight sweetness of stevia . 
i recommend against this case and suggest you purchase one with a more secure closing mechanism . 
purchased this to charge my new android tablet in the car on trips . 
ended up making my ear ring until i had things set where i wanted them . 
i ve had to repair it a few times as it s % plastic . 
this is the best cookware i ve ever owned . 
cannot believe i paid almost $ for this piece of junk  including shipping  . 
not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry . 
i love keens ,  but he found the toe box too big and the heel slightly large . 
i thought they were sized for kids  which they are  ,  they seem to hurt more . 
i was also very disappointed at how quickly it drains the batteries . 
i may get one for my son next christmas . 
if the mic is then flipped up your other party ,  if still connected on their end ,  can hear you . 
my daughter gets considerable excitement when she puts in a coin ,  turns the handle ,  and gets a gumball . 
but trying to justify the initial price ,  as well as the overly expensive replacement heads just can t happen . 
i made the mistake of buying two sharks ,  this one and a small hand held one for my car . 
the good thing about this game is that the steering and control are very tight . 
i can not send it back due to shipping requirements . 
i have a tiny office ,  so this is underneath my desk ,  which isn t ideal for circulating the air . 
i just apply popcorn salt after it has popped . 
it really is not different at all . they put that starforce antipiracy crap on the disk . 
i have these in plum and when i ordered them they were called  rimmed pasta plates  . 
as the clock clicked by num_extend i still felt sluggish . 
i read over all the negative reviews just before posting this one . 
however ,  even with preheating ,  some airpots won t do well in a couple hours of winter weather . 
ekobrew ,  the coffee always stays in that bottom wedge section . 
i was waiting on a replacement phone and needed something to work . 
just drop the battery in ,  set the clock and you re ready to go . 
i can t send it back again because i don t have it . 
they are sturdy ,  useful ,  and a great price to boot . 
it is hard for me to find comfortable bras sized num_extend
a great substitute for an expensive wine thief . 
can t beat it for the price on a prime membership . 
this powergen external battery saved me from being without a phone once while in italy . 
but ,  the pre uses the same battery as the centro and battery life is terrible . 
it is very compact and because of the wheels ,  easily moved . 
if any of you guys have ever read my reviews . 
i make my own sausage such as chicken ,  fennel ,  and apple that is not only healthier but fresher . 
i packed the thing up twice for purposes to taking it back to best buy . 
my husband and i managed to break both of these this year . 
after a few minutes they just slide down my face and i m constantly adjusting them . 
most mixing bowls are round right ?  this is whisking the sides as well as the bottom of the bowl . 
try adding parmesan and thyme as it suggests ,  the results are sensational . 
basically plug it in and let it warm up for a while then get to frying . 
i just got the case and i love it . 
after having excellent out of the box experiences with linksys products in the past they got my purchase . 
i definitely recommend this seller and this item to any and everybody !  ! tiffanni  : d . 
the brewed coffee was very weak ,  and the flavor was poor . 
num_num of my friends have purchased these headphones within num_num week of my recommendation . 
it takes little space on your counter or in your cupboard . 
their flagging sales surely signal the end of their foolish publishing decisions . 
imagine my surprise when the diarrhea never went away . 
i don t know how to return it ,  but wish i could . 
i just purchased this model mainly for my new ipad . 
i would rate this corer num_num stars for functionality and usefulness . 
so much for australia !  i also purchased a pair of ugg ansley charms ,  they were too tight . 
the second point falls far below the first point on importance ,  but it s still an issue for me . 
kayak on the hullavator without exceeding thule s load rating for the thule roof rack . 
along with multiple devices it doesn t charge efficiently . i like it , though and would recommend it . 
the cups nestle nicely and they clean up easily and do not stain . 
it doesn t really open all that easily as advertised . 
it is almost as if it was never sanded down properly . 
it falls off the edges and i really can t use it anymore . 
if you are a serious cook who wants serious quality cookware ,  then all clad is a great option . 
this does it in one easy motion and there s a scraper that will get any leftovers from the sides . 
anything to save my valuable home time for other chores is a bargin . 
the characters are so pixelated to the point that they look like walking squares . 
if you only eat garlic once in a blue moon ,  again ,  this is fine . 
i sometimes wear this as a sleep bra ,  it is that soft and stretchy . 
i will give it a go and post another review . 
i got these for my daughter and they were not worth the money . 
i use mine to store books and toys . 
if you spend a little more you can probably find a better mount else where . 
i ordered this on weds aug num_extend num_num and it arrived usps on friday before noon . 
i make fries all the time and this cut down my time . 
never used soap ,  oiled a bit after use . 
it functions as expected and is dishwasher safe . i highly recommend it . 
we are very satisfied with our collection of wusthof kitchen cutlery and these are no exception . 
you will see this screen over and over and over again . 
a great cookware set for the little i paid for it . 
but the rhinestones stay on well and it s a cute case . 
i also like the fact it does not make a huge amount i have to store somewhere . 
i wonder what were they thinking when they made this product . 
you re supposed to put together three little megablok pieces to create a single dresser drawer or kitchen cabinet unit . 
replaced bowl and cover parts for older processor . 
the base housing wipes down easily ,  with no crevices to collect gunk . 
very disappointed !  !  !  returned .  .  . lace wasn t soft ,  so definantly uncomfortable . 
works fine ,  what can go wrong with a french press . 
i have ordered multiple boxes of this product over the last few years . 
i bought num_num of these and use them as backups in my cars . 
i use it for honey and it is a nice size to keep on the countertop . 
the good news is that in lego star wars there is no such thing as a game over . 
i fell in love with the knives after using my num_extend chef knife for about num_num months . 
not knocking just for me products but this did not work for my daughter s hair . 
i m tempted to buy another of these and keep it safe ,  just in case i lose this one too . 
this is an excellent item and for the price . 
the knife it self is not so great . 
and there are usually tons of food sources they already have access too . 
it cleans up nicely and doesn t take much room to store . 
we don t have this problem with our older ,  smaller drinkwell . 
like the outer pocket that is large enough to hold my regular and dough hooks . 
i highly recommend this beautiful and quality bundt cake pan . 
sound quality is good for music and calls . 
the incredible includes that plus includes htc sense ,  which adds a few nice tweaks to the basic android software . 
it took num_num whole days for all of the bubbles to come out ,  but they are completely gone . 
instead ,  the flavor was sweet and tasted like a pineapple dum dum lollipop . 
it is closed which means it has to stand up in a corner somewhere . 
this kind of conversation may be realistic ,  but it s not interesting ,  and it s bad num_extend
it was because i had too much protein built up in my hair . 
now it has a slight pink tint to it around the bumper surfaces . 
i have found gel liners have worked best ,  the drugstore kind that come with a baby brush applicator . 
warms and maintains a bedroom at a very comfortable temperature for the size . 
it is comfortable and just the right length for my needs . 
every time ,  the other end of the line complains of horrible noise . 
i bought it quit after num_num years of use with great care in handling it . 
very durable and the price is much better than buying from a phone store or mall kiosk . 
the replacement arrived and died after only two uses . 
it is nothing exceptional ,  but is adequate and services its purpose well . 
with a little pressure the gun would slide into the holster but pulling it out was nearly impossible . 
in the garbage now !  don t waste your money !  !  !  . 
the uneven seams irritated my face after num_num minutes in the pool . 
this very heavy duty juicer did a great job for me with lemons ,  oranges ,  and small grapefruit . 
they love them and they seem to fit well . 
i like strong black coffee ,  and i do like illy brand coffe . 
use a plastic spatula to scrape off remains . 
a screen button appears on the left if you want to use the dimming num_extend
will sigma win more customers if they do ?  yes . 
i would prefer it on the motor housing . 
 if you never had the older version ,  this one might not frustrate you as much as it does me . 
do you have to have skill to use this ?  nope . 
they do not allow you to cancel your account online ,  you have to call their customer service line . 
the best thing about this tool is the ruler embossed on one side . 
in the end i was taken care of and the new hat it just fine for my head . 
a recording informs you of your battery level once activated with your phone . 
it s pretty heavy and bulky on the sides too . 
the box is nice ,  but it s not for storing the knives after use . 
the sounds are great ,  but the wear and tear are not . 
but on this one ,  both outlets are putting out enough wattage for the tablet . 
my bodyglove case deteriated after the year . this case fits perfectly and protects the phone . 
i like most of campbells soups and this was a huge disappointment . 
not the manufacturers fault as purina makes great products . 
this battery on this bluetooth last a looonngg time and i enjoy it everyday . 
i have made about eight loaves since i got it ,  and every one came out fine . 
after every washed started to make like spots and straight lines of white . 
the graphics are crap  !  and the story is just not interistting . 
i looked at it for a long time ,  i never found a clear explanation of what it actually is . 
i was simply being honest about how this product didn t work for me . 
it s faintly berry flavored ,  but mostly i got burning acid taste from it . 
i lost vertical comfort because of strong pressure ,  if that makes sense . 
i tried them out because they were a good price but i wouldn t buy them again . 
i ordered both the ruffies clear contractor bags as well as these from amazon . 
i ve had this for a year and a half and it hasn t failed . 
this is a very good option for protection . 
i bought this product based on the reviews . 
i bought this blender about num_num years ago and had to replace the coupling just into the num_extend year . 
cheap chinese pos cooks good burgers and gives you lung cancer to boot . 
there is no keyboard reference sheet ,  and there are at least num_num commands to memorize and use . 
i don t have an isi brand whipped cream dispenser either . 
obviously ,  this does not work for me ,  which should be no surprise as not much does . 
i love roasted seaweed and can eat pack after pack but the wasabi kind is not good . 
i received my pitcher a little over a week ago . 
at the two month mark ,  the earpiece cracked and the earbud fell off . 
i m very clumsy and drop my cell phone all the time . 
i m glad to have this  sure miss city life  and recommend it . 
usually carry around my neck or wrap up and store in briefcase . the quality is crystal clear . 
this is very nice ,  it s not slippery and it fits well in my hands . 
this case is really beautifully designed  ,  but is poorly made for durability . 
when they opened it ,  every single one of the bowls had the handle broken off . 
when i was little my grandma had one in her kitchen that i would stare at during meals . 
for me ,  this purchase was money wasted .  .  . lesson learned . 
the price was not great for how poor of a product this is . 
the larger one is good for applesauce etc . 
i have no way to measure that ,  so decide who you want to trust . most car chargers are only num_extend
it looks constructed beautifully and should last for years . 
new trent comes to my rescue once more . 
the material is soooooo cheap as well as the stitching holding out together . 
be advised this fits somewhat loose on a num_extend  hercules  case is a close fit but not perfect . 
i was shocked that i didn t even have to swithch back and forth to deside which were better . 
it s easy to use ,  easy to clean ,  and doesn t take up too much space . 
mine died a few weeks ago ,  and i replaced it with a logitech ultrax keyboard . 
tomorrow ,  i m picking a few bushels of tomatoes for sauce and juice !  . 
if it didn t hurt i would have kept it . 
it certains keeps from screen free from dirt and as well scratches . 
did everything possible to get it to work ,  but no go . 
the smell is overpowering and it gives me headaches . 
design of this ge filter at the outset . 
they do scratch easily ,  but that doesn t matter .
